60389;China’s Central Bank Cuts Loan Prime Rates;The reduction in the rates, which are used to set corporate loans and home mortgages, signaled concern that the country’s postpandemic rebound was stalling.;China’s central bank cut key interest rates on Tuesday for loans issued by the state-controlled banking system, in the clearest sign yet of mounting concern in the Chinese government and corporate sector that the country’s economy is stalling.The interest rate cut was small — a tenth of a percentage point for the country’s benchmark one-year and five-year interest rates for loans. But because almost all of the country’s corporate lending and mortgages are linked to the two rates, the reductions could have some effect on the overall pace of economic growth.The move by the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, puts China at odds with policies in the West. The Federal Reserve spent over a year battling inflation by raising rates before pausing this month. The European Central Bank has also been pushing up interest rates in response to inflation.But China has the opposite problem: Spending and private sector investment are so weak that businesses have been vying with one another to cut prices to keep customers. Consumer and producer prices fell for the four months through May.Investors were underwhelmed by the central bank’s rate cuts, with share prices in Hong Kong and Shanghai slipping on Tuesday. The rate cut was slightly smaller than many investors had hoped for and provided a reminder that the Chinese economy is struggling.China’s currency, the renminbi, also weakened against the dollar. In recent months, lower interest rates in China than in the United States have created an incentive for companies and households in China to move their money out of the country, working around China’s stringent restrictions on large overseas transfers of funds.Cutting rates is slow-working medicine for the Chinese economy, said Han Shen Lin, a former deputy general manager for China at Wells Fargo Bank who now teaches finance at New York University in Shanghai. Corporations typically negotiate once a year with their banks on their borrowing limit, then take out loans of anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months. Only as new loans are made, or existing loans are rolled over, is the lower interest rate applied.The central bank’s reduction on Tuesday “will seep through the system, but only gradually,” Mr. Lin said.Households will need to wait even longer to benefit. Interest rates on mortgages are almost always adjustable in China. But the adjustment often happens in January, China’s central bank said on Tuesday, in an explanatory statement that accompanied the announcement of the interest rate reduction.So while people buying homes in the next few months may benefit from the new cuts, many homeowners will need to wait longer.The move on Tuesday was the first reduction in loan rates by China since August, when the country’s economy was still struggling after a two-month Covid lockdown in Shanghai. The latest cuts send the message that Beijing wants to stabilize output while exports are falling, construction has stagnated and consumer confidence is weak. The government’s abrupt abandonment of Covid controls at the end of last year had spurred hope that China’s economy would snap back.The modest scale of the interest rate reductions suggests concern among China’s economic policymakers, but not panic. As the global financial crisis gathered speed in late 2008, by contrast, China’s central bank cut its benchmark loan and deposit rates 1.08 percentage points in a single day. And during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, China cut loan rates 1.44 percentage points in one day.Tuesday’s cut brought the benchmark one-year rate to 3.55 percent from 3.65 percent. Companies typically pay the benchmark rate plus one or more percentage points, with smaller companies and private-sector businesses paying more than big companies and state-owned enterprises.The five-year rate, used as a benchmark for setting mortgage rates, was cut to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent. Home buyers and homeowners often pay another percentage point above that level.;The Federal Reserve spent over a year battling inflation by raising rates before pausing this month.Interest rates on mortgages are almost always adjustable in China.As the global financial crisis gathered speed in late 2008, by contrast, China’s central bank cut its benchmark loan and deposit rates 1.08 percentage points in a single day.;2023-06-20T17:48:29+00:00;2023-06-21T10:38:56.324121+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60390;Producer Ryan Murphy Is Expected to Move to Disney;Mr. Murphy, the force behind hits like “American Horror Story” and “The Watcher,” is coming to the end of his $300 million Netflix deal.;Ryan Murphy, the television megaproducer behind hits like “American Horror Story” and “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” is poised to move his operation to the Walt Disney Company, five years after he stunned Hollywood by decamping to Netflix for a $300 million deal.The contract talks with Disney are not finished, according to three people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. No deal is expected to be completed until after the screenwriters’ strike in Hollywood is resolved, one of the people said. (Unionized film and television writers have been on strike since May 1.)But the talks between Mr. Murphy and Disney are advanced, the people said. Mr. Murphy’s contract with Netflix expires at the end of the month. Renewal talks with Netflix never got off the ground.Representatives for Mr. Murphy, Disney and Netflix either declined to comment or did not return calls. Bloomberg reported Mr. Murphy’s likely move to Disney earlier on Tuesday.A deal with Disney would formally reunite Mr. Murphy with executives he worked closely with for more than a decade. Disney owns the FX cable channel, which is home to his “American Horror Story” franchise, which started in 2011. (The series also runs on Hulu, which Disney controls.) ABC, the Disney-owned broadcast network, recently bought the rights to “9-1-1,” a drama that Mr. Murphy created for Fox in 2018.When Mr. Murphy signed his Netflix deal, in February 2018, it was just six months after another star producer, Shonda Rhimes, had signed her own nine-figure contract with the streaming company. The back-to-back signings were an emphatic statement by Netflix that it was in the business of paying any price for big-name writers. In the process, it set off a Hollywood arms race (which, amid broader concerns about the streaming business and the writers’ strike, has mostly cooled off).Mr. Murphy’s tenure at Netflix got off to a bumpy start. Misfires included “The Politician” and “Hollywood.” It was not until last September that Mr. Murphy served up bona fide hits in “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” and “The Watcher.” Both series are among the 10 most-watched Netflix originals ever, according to the streaming service.Mr. Murphy, who continued making shows for Disney even though he was under contract with Netflix — new seasons of “9-1-1” and “American Crime Story” continued apace — would likewise continue to make shows for Netflix after a move to Disney. The next edition of “Monster” will focus on Erik and Lyle Menéndez, the brothers serving life sentences for killing their wealthy parents in 1989, and “The Watcher” has been renewed for another season.;But the talks between Mr. Murphy and Disney are advanced, the people said.Mr. Murphy’s contract with Netflix expires at the end of the month.Renewal talks with Netflix never got off the ground.Representatives for Mr. Murphy, Disney and Netflix either declined to comment or did not return calls.;2023-06-21T01:24:49+00:00;2023-06-21T10:38:56.787865+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60391;How Pay Transparency Laws Help and Limit Job Seekers;Salary disclosure laws have been a boon for workers searching for jobs that pay fairly — but only when the advertised pay bands are narrow enough to be useful.;Last December, Yun Yati Naing began searching for the job she would begin after graduating from Baruch College in New York City. It was one month after a law passed by the city went into effect requiring employers with four or more employees to post salary ranges on all new job advertisements.“All my friends were talking about it,” Ms. Naing said. “It really made a difference going into the work force as a fresh graduate. We had no idea what the wages of these entry-level jobs were.”Thanks to the new disclosure requirements, Ms. Naing, who was interested in a career in finance, was able to filter out opportunities that paid less than $50,000, the minimum salary she hoped to earn. She tracked job opportunities on an Excel spreadsheet, and, after a flurry of interviews and offers, she accepted a job in financial services that advertised starting pay between $54,000 and $79,000.Her new employer’s offer came in at $60,000, and she negotiated a modest increase. She graduated in early June and has just started work.More and more young people like Ms. Naing are entering job searches with a cleareyed view of how much money they can expect to earn, the result of a spate of new laws that require employers to list pay ranges on job advertisements. Salary transparency legislation has been enacted in California, Washington State, Colorado and a handful of cities including New York. Illinois passed a wage transparency law in May.More than one-fourth of the U.S. labor force is now covered by salary transparency legislation, according to an estimate by the National Women’s Law Center. Norms are shifting nationwide: At Indeed, a job search website, about 45 percent of all advertisements for work in the United States now carry a pay range disclosure, up from less than 20 percent before the pandemic.Lawmakers often introduce pay transparency laws in an effort to help reduce gender and racial wage gaps. Women working full time in the United States are paid about 84 percent as much as men, according to the Department of Labor, and Black, Hispanic and Native American workers earn 73 to 77 cents for every dollar earned by white workers. Requiring employers to list salary ranges helps demystify a job search.“They can rest assured that what they’re getting is fair, and they can feel more confident about that choice,” said Ellen Stein, director of the Starr Career Development Center at Baruch.For some workers, the disclosure law has revealed pay disparities where they work. Kimberly Nguyen, a 25-year-old poet and UX writer who writes consumer-facing text for digital products, was scrolling through LinkedIn in March when she found a listing for her own job. She had recently been hired by the consulting agency Photon to work as a contractor for Citigroup on a team that included full-time employees and other contractors.During the interview process, Ms. Nguyen said, she was told that the only way to secure a full-time job at Citi was to work as a contractor first, and that the company’s goal was to eventually hire all contractors as full-time employees through a process called conversion. She was told that she would be eligible for conversion after six months of contract work.When the job posting for a UX copywriting position at Citi popped up on her LinkedIn feed, Ms. Nguyen thought it might signal a permanent job opening for one of the contractors. The difference in pay was substantial: She was making $85,000, and the salary range on the job listing was $117,200 to $175,800.“If the salary were maybe a $10,000 to $15,000 difference, I would be like, OK, that makes sense,” Ms. Nguyen said. “The contracting agency has to get their cut. Citi’s paying them to pay me. But the gap is so big.”Posting on Twitter about the situation, Ms. Nguyen wrote, “My company just listed on LinkedIn a job posting for what I’m currently doing (so we’re hiring another UX writer) and now thanks to salary transparency laws, I see that they intend to pay this person $32k-$90k more than they currently pay me, so I applied.”Later, she attended a meeting where she asked her Citi supervisors about the job advertisement. Some of the other contractors on her team had also reached out to management with questions about the post and the salary, which was higher than what they were earning. Frustrated after not receiving a clear response, she added to her Twitter thread.The thread went viral, drawing attention to the issue. But when we spoke in June, nothing had changed. Ms. Nguyen was still working for Photon as a contractor at Citi and had not received a raise. She hadn’t heard of anyone on her team of contractors being hired full time at the bank, though a few had been laid off. Three weeks ago, she checked her application status for the Citi job. She was no longer being considered for the role. She has been searching for new opportunities.“Obviously the point of the law is for people to be able to advocate for themselves,” Ms. Nguyen said. “But no one’s required to do anything as a result.”Neither Citi nor Photon responded to requests for comment.In some cases, employers have avoided disclosing specific pay practices by posting job advertisements with salary ranges that could apply to anyone at the company, from a new hire in a cubicle to an executive with a corner office. At Netflix, for example, current job postings in California show pay ranges from $60,000 to $290,000 for a role in consumer products and $195,000 to $510,000 for a senior manager in talent and recruiting. Netflix did not respond to questions on how it had determined those ranges.“While the whole enterprise is generally more helpful than not, there can be some ranges that are not that informative when they’re so large,” Dr. Stein of Baruch said.Ms. Naing, the recent graduate, estimated that a quarter of the job postings she had encountered during her search in New York displayed ranges that were too wide to be useful.The practice may be spreading in high-paying industries. Recent research by economists at the Indeed Hiring Lab has shown that published salary ranges are getting wider for occupations in pharmacy, medical information, scientific research and development, and other industries. Pay estimates for jobs in food preparation and child care are growing more precise.“In general, occupations that are more likely to be remote and have higher pay seem to be having widening ranges, whereas those that are more likely to be lower-paid positions and are more likely to be in person are starting to see more narrowing in the last year,” Cory Stahle, the author of the Hiring Lab report, said.One possible explanation for the opposing trends is unevenness in the labor market. While hiring at many tech companies has slowed in the past year, demand for workers in child care has remained strong. A tight labor market may pressure an employer to compete for workers, resulting in a more precise (and potentially higher) pay rate on a job listing.By contrast, in industries that have seen layoffs, employers may be able to attract qualified applicants without posting exact salaries.Mr. Stahle’s research also noted a geographic trend in pay data: Of the 10 cities with the most significantly widening ranges, seven were in areas with new transparency laws.State and local governments have not said how they intend to crack down on employers that list overly broad salary ranges or sidestep pay disclosure entirely. In Colorado, where a transparency law has been in effect since 2021, a spokesperson for the Department of Labor and Employment said the state had issued 19 citations for violations of the law, most of which did not include fines, and had notified more than 440 companies of possible noncompliance.Most of these companies corrected the issue before the state began a formal investigation. The spokesperson said that Colorado had not issued any warnings for overly broad salary ranges, and that the state was focusing on voluntary compliance rather than fines.A press officer for the New York City Commission on Human Rights said the city had received more than 300 tips about noncompliance, but the officer did not answer questions about the substance of the complaints or whether any fines or warning letters had been issued.Companies may find it necessary to support transparency measures in order to attract job applicants. In a survey of more than 1,000 postsecondary students and recent graduates conducted in December by Adobe, 85 percent said they would be less likely to apply for a job if the company did not disclose the salary range in the job posting.Ms. Naing, the recent graduate, said it felt as if some companies were listing huge salary ranges “just to be spiteful,” adding that she hoped to see less of it in the future.;Last December, Yun Yati Naing began searching for the job she would begin after graduating from Baruch College in New York City.Salary transparency legislation has been enacted in California, Washington State, Colorado and a handful of cities including New York.She has been searching for new opportunities.“Obviously the point of the law is for people to be able to advocate for themselves,” Ms. Nguyen said.;2023-06-20T10:16:57+00:00;2023-06-21T10:38:57.376747+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60392;Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang Will Leave Top Post, Replaced by Joseph Tsai;The Chinese tech giant says its top leader, Daniel Zhang, will make way for two long-serving executives: Joseph Tsai takes over as chairman and Eddie Yongming Wu becomes chief executive.;In late March, Daniel Zhang unveiled what was called the “most significant” overhaul in the 24-year history of Alibaba, one of China’s original technology conglomerates, splitting the company into six units that would help them seek out investors from the public.Now, Mr. Zhang, the tech giant’s chairman and chief executive, is out of the top job and will step down from Alibaba’s board of directors, and two of the company’s co-founders have moved up into the leadership positions.Alibaba announced on Tuesday that Mr. Zhang, 51, will relinquish his top job in September. Instead, he will serve only as chief executive of Alibaba’s cloud computing division, a position he assumed in March when he unveiled the restructuring. Alibaba announced plans to spin off its cloud division in May, in preparation for a public listing.Joseph Tsai, 59, an Alibaba veteran with roots to the company’s founding, will move up from executive vice chairman to chairman. Another Alibaba co-founder, Eddie Yongming Wu, will succeed Mr. Zhang as chief executive.“This is like the oldest of the old guard,” said Duncan Clark, the chairman of the investment advisory firm BDA China in Beijing. “The trusted team, the old guard, is back in control.”Alibaba is reshuffling its leadership at a critical time. The company was the highest-profile target of a crackdown by Beijing on the power of China’s biggest tech companies. Its stock price has tumbled from its 2020 peak.Alibaba’s founder, the billionaire Jack Ma, was driven out of the public eye in 2020 after criticizing Chinese regulators for stifling innovation at Ant Group, Alibaba’s financial technology sister company. After his remarks, Chinese officials suspended plans for Ant Group to sell stock in an initial public offering. In 2021 Chinese antitrust regulators fined Alibaba $2.8 billion for preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms.Mr. Ma, a popular figure in China and long the face of the company, made a publicized return to China this year just as Alibaba announced its restructuring, which was seen in part as a response to tighter regulations by Beijing.On Saturday, Mr. Ma appeared at a math competition sponsored by a research division of Alibaba, according to a post on the institute’s blog. Though he no longer holds a formal role at Alibaba, Mr. Ma remains one of its largest shareholders, with 4.5 percent of the company as of 2021, according to corporate filings.In a letter to employees Tuesday, Mr. Zhang said it was time for him to dedicate his “full attention” to the spinoff plans. He also cited the need for a clear separation between his roles at Alibaba and the cloud division.Mr. Tsai, the new chairman, has a relationship to Mr. Ma that some former employees have described as inseparable. The two met in 1999, when Alibaba was still a free online portal, and Mr. Tsai joined the company that year. He helped Mr. Ma secure early investments from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank, and stewarded the company’s initial public offering in New York in 2014, then the largest in history.Alibaba’s executive vice chairman since 2013, Mr. Tsai is the primary owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the National Basketball Association team.The elevation of Mr. Wu, a longtime executive of Alibaba’s e-commerce division, signaled to analysts that Alibaba would continued to make online shopping a core pillar of its business.Mr. Wu, who is in his late 40s, helped lead Alibaba’s transformation from an e-commerce giant to a mobile juggernaut, turning the digital payment app Alipay into one of the default forms of payment across China. He will continue to serve as the chairman of Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba’s two domestic e-commerce businesses.Mr. Zhang told investors that Alibaba would become less centralized and more efficient by spinning off its components. But Alibaba has also recently announced the creation of a high-level committee to make decisions about distributing money to the new business groups, which some analysts took as a sign that the company was still keeping power in the hands of a few key people.Mr. Zhang succeeded Mr. Ma as chairman of Alibaba in 2019. Then a rising star in the company, he was the architect behind Singles Day, Alibaba’s most successful shopping event. Known for his attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, Mr. Zhang was widely regarded as a complement to Mr. Ma, who was known inside the company for his visionary prowess.Alibaba is synonymous with online shopping in China. But the company has since expanded into an array of businesses from digital payments to delivery services to entertainment. In recent years, it has expanded its e-commerce division and has served the A.I. boom with its cloud computing unit.Jacob Cooke, chief executive of WPIC, an e-commerce consultancy, said the return of Mr. Tsai, who has extensive investments around the world, was a logical choice for Alibaba given its recent international focus.Last year, Alibaba poured $1.6 billion into its e-commerce business in Southeast Asia, according to corporate records in Singapore provided by VentureCap Insights, a research firm. And last week, it announced plans to start a local version of its e-commerce division, Tmall, in Europe.;Instead, he will serve only as chief executive of Alibaba’s cloud computing division, a position he assumed in March when he unveiled the restructuring.The two met in 1999, when Alibaba was still a free online portal, and Mr. Tsai joined the company that year.Then a rising star in the company, he was the architect behind Singles Day, Alibaba’s most successful shopping event.;2023-06-20T19:19:15+00:00;2023-06-21T10:38:57.957307+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60393;Gannett Sues Google, Accusing It of Dominating the Ad Market;The country’s largest newspaper chain said Google’s power over ad technology has contributed to the decline of local news.;Gannett, the country’s largest newspaper chain, filed a lawsuit against Google on Tuesday, accusing the tech giant of violating federal antitrust laws by illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology used by publishers to buy and sell online ads.In the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York against Google and its parent company, Alphabet, Gannett argued that Google’s dominance over the digital ad market had greatly cut into potential revenue for those publishers.While the online ad market is worth $200 billion a year, the complaint said, news publishers have seen a nearly 70 percent decrease in advertising revenue since 2009, which has diminished journalism jobs and put many newspapers out of business.“Google controls how publishers sell their ad slots, and it forces publishers to sell growing shares of that ad space to Google at depressed prices,” the complaint said. “The result is dramatically less revenue for publishers and Google’s ad-tech rivals, while Google enjoys exorbitant monopoly profits.”The case is the latest in a string of lawsuits brought against Google for its ad practices. In January, the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, looking to break up its monopoly in digital advertising, and the European Commission filed a similar case last Wednesday. Britain’s antitrust authority has also been investigating Google’s advertising practices.“News publishers depend on digital ad revenue to provide timely, cutting-edge reporting and essential content communities rely on,” Mike Reed, the chief executive of Gannett, said in a statement, “yet Google’s practices have had negative implications that depress not only revenue, but also force the reduction and footprint of local news.”Gannett publishes USA Today as well as more than 200 daily newspapers across the country, including The Arizona Republic and The Palm Beach Post. The publisher said in the lawsuit that it had shut down more than 170 publications since 2019.Dan Taylor, vice president of Google Ads, said in a response to the lawsuit on Tuesday: “These claims are simply wrong.”Mr. Taylor said that publishers had many options for advertising technology, and that when they used Google tools “they keep the vast majority of the revenue.”“We’ll show the court how our advertising products benefit publishers and help them fund their content online,” he added.Google earned nearly 80 percent of its $60 billion profit last year from advertising, which underpins popular services like search, YouTube and email.;;2023-06-20T19:53:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:38:58.445247+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60395;The Tropicana, a Relic on the Las Vegas Strip, Could Be Demolished;The Tropicana Las Vegas, built in 1957, held the city’s longest-running cabaret and was synonymous with its swinging midcentury glory. It could be torn down to make way for a baseball stadium.;"In 1957, the Tropicana opened as the most lavish hotel and casino in Las Vegas, with a cascading 60-foot fountain and shimmering pool that piped Muzak underwater. The magicians Siegfried and Roy debuted there; Sean Connery’s James Bond stayed the night; and the Corleones of “The Godfather” took over. Feathered showgirls danced in its Folies Bergère cabaret, and the Tropicana became synonymous with the Strip’s swinging midcentury glory.But on a recent weekday afternoon, just a few patrons played flashing slot machines inside the dimly lit, smoky casino. Beneath its ornate stained-glass ceiling, some of the blackjack and roulette tables were closed. A handful of people drank at the bar, where they watched the Vegas Golden Knights, the city’s new N.H.L. team. Outside, in the near 100-degree heat, middle-aged visitors in bikinis languished near an artificial rock formation by the pool.It’s been decades since the heyday of the Tropicana. And Las Vegas, always evolving, is finally offering a form of entertainment found in other big American cities: major professional sports teams. Now the faded resort, one of the city’s oldest casinos, stands in the way.Last week, the governor of Nevada signed a bill agreeing to finance up to $380 million of the $1.5 billion stadium to lure the Oakland Athletics to a site on the Las Vegas Strip. The project, which has yet to be finalized, could mean the demolition of the Tropicana Las Vegas, as it is now known. The resort would become another casualty in a city that is ever-changing to please its visitors; one notorious for imploding the old to make way for the new.Las Vegas was once considered taboo for major sports because of its strong association with gambling on games, which is now legal in many states. If the A’s move to the city, the Major League Baseball team would follow the N.F.L., the N.H.L., the W.N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. Last week, the Golden Knights, the city’s first major sports franchise, won the Stanley Cup.While some welcome the city’s ascendance as a pro sports destination, others are nostalgic for a bygone era embodied by the Tropicana — when lounge acts like the Frank Sinatra-led Rat Pack made Vegas world famous and sparkling resorts materialized in the desert. Now, all but a handful of the casinos from that era are gone.Often, their demolition has been made spectacle: In 1993, a crowd estimated at 200,000 people gazed on as a faux pirate ship at the newly-opened Treasure Island resort appeared to blow up The Dunes (built in 1955) to make way for the $1.6 billion Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Three years later, The Hacienda (1956) was wired with hundreds of New Year’s Eve fireworks that brought it tumbling down in a blazing display of light. In 2016, the Riviera Hotel and Casino (1955) was also serenaded by fireworks before being imploded into a pile of debris and dust.“It’s sort of an inevitable kind of process here in Las Vegas, where we’re in a constant state of evolution,” said Geoff Schumacher, the author of “Sun, Sin & Suburbia: The History of Modern Las Vegas” and an executive at the city’s Mob Museum. But, he added, “that doesn’t mean we can’t be a little bit sad about it.”On Thursday, Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada, a Republican, signed the bill approved by the Democratic Legislature to allow for the portion of public financing for the 30,000-seat stadium, inching the Tropicana closer to its demise. The next step in that plan will be the approval of M.L.B.’s owners to relocate — a process that Commissioner Rob Manfred said could come together quickly when he was asked about it last month. Bally’s Corporation, which owns the hotel and casino, had already reached a deal with the A’s to assign nine acres of the 35-acre parcel to the stadium.In a memo sent in May to staff, the company said that operations at the Tropicana could cease within the next two years, but that the site would eventually reopen as a “new integrated casino hotel resort and baseball park.” Staff, it added, would lose their jobs. “We anticipate that employees will find an enhanced career opportunity when the casino hotel resort reopens,” the company said.Soo Kim, the chairman of Bally’s, said in a text message that the memo had since been retracted and that many of the resort’s plans were still “up in the air.” A revised memo provided on Sunday by Mr. Kim did not specify a timeline for closure and said instead that the Tropicana would stay open “as long as practicable.”In an interview, Mr. Kim said that the renovation was ultimately an opportunity to grow employment.“The Trop is obviously iconic, but it is, really, in a lot of ways, economically obsolete,” Mr. Kim said, noting that the 35-acre site was worth more than the current economic capacity of the casino. “It literally is part of the glitz and glamour of Vegas, but it hasn’t been that for decades,” he added, noting that when it came to signing a deal to develop the site for a baseball stadium, it was a “no-brainer.”The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents tens of thousands of workers across Nevada, has vowed to protect employees of the Tropicana. “The union can help them find work during the remodel or the rebuild, and these workers have to be hired back first,” Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the union, said in an interview, noting that the workers’ contract stipulates they get a severance package. Not all of the casino’s workers, however, are in the union. “They’re at the whim of the employer,” Mr. Pappageorge said.Tawana Moore, who has been a guest room attendant at the Tropicana for 17 years, and is a union member, said on Thursday that workers had not heard anything from the company since the bill was signed into law. “We have made this our home,” Ms. Moore said in an earlier interview. “We’re sad, but happy at the same time — sad because we’ve been here forever, and some people don’t know how to start over, and some people are happy, because change is good. I welcome change.”The looming stadium deal is not the first time the Tropicana has been threatened. Shortly after the 300-room resort opened, an attempt on the life of the crime boss Frank Costello exposed his ties to the casino, plunging it into controversy. By the 1970s, the resort was already struggling to compete with larger operations like Caesars Palace, and at the end of that decade, the F.B.I. exposed a mob-skimming operation that eventually forced the owners to sell the property. The Tropicana has since changed hands several times.At every turn, the resort has tried to reinvent itself, morphing in the late 1980s into a family-friendly destination, complete with a water park, flamingoes and talking parrots — rebranded “The Island of Las Vegas.” Visitors could swim up to the blackjack table, and dry their money, according to an article in The New York Times. Twenty-five years later, the hotel was redone again, this time to mimic the atmosphere of South Beach, a luxury neighborhood in Miami. The tagline: “Surprise — it’s the new Tropicana Las Vegas.”For nearly seven decades, the Tropicana has reflected “the changing images of the Strip,” said Stefan Al, an architect and the author of “The Strip: Las Vegas and the Architecture of the American Dream.”“Maybe for the previous generation that was going to the casino and pressing a button on the slot machine. But for today’s generation, that may mean seeing a sports event, but also betting around that,” he said. “It’s a very different form of leisure.”Some are lamenting the impending demise of another piece of the city’s history, but are not at all surprised. “I do miss old Vegas, but everything’s going to change eventually, so you might as well get used to it,” said Tyler Ricca, a tattooed man in cargo shorts who on a weekday afternoon was playing four-card keno and smoking Marlboros inside the Tropicana.Mr. Ricca, 36, a regular, shrugged and looked around — the casino was largely empty, save for a few people who said they were escaping the crowds of the larger casinos. Outside, a hot breeze rippled through the fronds of towering palms.“I was sad,” Kathi Thorpe, a Canadian visitor, said of the closure as she headed to the pool. But, she added, “It’s Vegas. You expect things to get torn down and rebuilt.”";In 1957, the Tropicana opened as the most lavish hotel and casino in Las Vegas, with a cascading 60-foot fountain and shimmering pool that piped Muzak underwater.And Las Vegas, always evolving, is finally offering a form of entertainment found in other big American cities: major professional sports teams.The project, which has yet to be finalized, could mean the demolition of the Tropicana Las Vegas, as it is now known.;2023-06-20T21:06:57+00:00;2023-06-21T10:38:59.407479+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60399;Child Care Disruptions Expected as Record Funding Nears an End;Three million children could be affected as the largest investment in child care in U.S. history expires in September.;For two years, the United States has been effectively running an experiment in federally funding child care providers. The $24 billion disbursed in pandemic relief has been the largest investment in child care in U.S. history. Child care providers have used the money to raise teachers’ pay, buy supplies and pay mortgages.In September, those funds expire, one of the last of the pandemic-era safety net benefits to end. It is a looming crisis for the industry, and could lead to tuition hikes, layoffs and closures. In all, child care could be disrupted for three million children, close to a third of those in child care, according to a report released Wednesday by the Century Foundation.Share of owners and directors who said they will:Note: The timing for final grant payments varies by state and recipient, but the majority of providers said they expected their last payments to be this year.Source: October 2022 survey conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young ChildrenThe New York TimesThe National Association for the Education of Young Children regularly surveys child care owners and workers. In its most recent survey on the grants, in October 2022, four in 10 directors and owners nationwide said they would have to raise tuition when grants ended this fall.More than a quarter said they would have to cut wages — from a median hourly wage of about $12. Nearly a third of providers, including 44 percent at those owned by minorities, said they might consider leaving their job or, in the case of home-based child care, closing altogether.“Federal funding made a huge difference,” said Julie Kashen, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an author of the new report. “There are going to be huge and dire consequences for child care employees, for families, for employers.”Children’s Corner, which cares for 80 children in Millcreek, Utah, has been receiving $26,000 a month in grants, said its director, Jen Whyte-Frederickson. Without the grants, she said, the center, which her parents started 40 years ago, would have closed during the pandemic.She used the money to raise hourly pay to $15 “because they all deserve it,” she said. When the grants end, she said, “the plan is raising tuition.” She already increased it to $985 from $900 monthly for a 2-year-old, and will probably raise it above $1,000.For Lorna Adkins, who runs Growing Places from her home in Huntington, W.Va., that’s not an option for her families: “Raise tuition? Not in West Virginia, not in this economy, not here.”She has been receiving $3,200 a month. She has spent it on wages, cleaning supplies, utilities and to offset rising food prices. After expenses, she said her take-home pay without the grants was about $2.50 an hour. With the grants ending, combined with rising costs and new regulations on providers, she said, she plans to retire early.“There are a lot of people in child care that are going to close down because of this,” she said. “It’s just a fact.”The federal relief funds saved the industry, analysts and providers say. One in three child care providers — 70,000 — receiving the grants might have closed. Unlike public schools, child care is almost entirely financed by private tuition. When it dried up during lockdowns, providers could not stay afloat.But the sector was precarious even before the pandemic. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called child care a textbook example of a broken market. Workers are paid less than in 98 percent of other professions, but many providers cannot raise prices because parents often can’t afford it. Already, half of parents spend more than 20 percent of their household income on child care.“The grants were really designed to prop up a system that had already been failing before the pandemic,” said Caitlin McLean of the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley.The pandemic also reshaped the business. In some places, parents are not using regular child care as often as they had been, with many working from home. Hiring has also become much harder, as other jobs, in many cases less demanding, have begun paying more.In the National Association for the Education of Young Children survey, two-thirds of providers said they were experiencing a staffing shortage, and of those, nearly half said they were caring for fewer children than they would like because of it.Three-quarters of child care providers who received grants have used funds to pay teachers. Now they face cutting pay — while in a hiring bind.“We are backed into a corner now, because we can’t decrease their wages because then we will definitely not have teachers, and we can’t increase our rates for parents because parents cannot pay any more than they are,” said Brooke Skidmore, who owns the Growing Tree in New Glarus, Wis., with her brother.The $24 billion to stabilize the industry came in the American Rescue Plan, and the grants were distributed by states according to varying rules. More than 80 percent of providers received them. Previously, federal support for child care came mainly through block grants that states use to subsidize care for low-income parents. Congress also increased these grants by $29 billion during the pandemic, set to expire in September 2024.Some Democrats in Congress want subsidies for child care to be extended or made permanent. Some Republicans have also proposed increased federal funding for child care.Senator Bernie Sanders, who recently released a report on the subject with Senator Patty Murray, said, “If we allow this cliff to take place and lose the billions of dollars that we put into stabilizing child care, it will make a disastrous situation even worse.”Yet Democrats’ large social safety net bill, which included subsidized child care and universal pre-K, failed to pass. Republicans, along with a Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, said the investments were too expensive, among other concerns. Senior Biden administration officials said billions in additional funding for child care providers appeared unlikely, especially given the recent push from Republicans to limit government spending.Some states and localities have found ways to continue to subsidize child care, and others are considering it. Minnesota made an investment of $750 million. Policymakers in Maine have proposed continuing pandemic-era investments. In November, New Mexico passed a constitutional amendment to guarantee a right to early childhood education.Adaeze Ngoddy, owner of the Rex Childcare and Early Learning Center in Rex, Ga., said she hoped there was a way to keep financial help coming. Even with $51,000 in monthly grants, her business has not fully recovered from the pandemic, she said, and has been unable to hire for six open teaching positions.“I’m hoping they continue until things actually do normalize,” she said.;For two years, the United States has been effectively running an experiment in federally funding child care providers.One in three child care providers — 70,000 — receiving the grants might have closed.Previously, federal support for child care came mainly through block grants that states use to subsidize care for low-income parents.;2023-06-21T09:00:37+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:01.345737+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60402;New York Passes Bill to Shield Abortion Providers Sending Pills to States With Bans;The measure is one of several recently enacted by states aiming to expand access to medication abortion for patients who live where it is outlawed.;The New York State Legislature gave final approval on Tuesday to legislation that provides legal protection for New York doctors to prescribe and send abortion pills to patients in states that have outlawed abortion.The measure, along with similar new laws in several other states controlled by Democrats, could significantly expand medication abortion access by allowing more patients in states that restrict abortion to end pregnancies at home, without traveling to states where abortion is legal.The New York bill now goes to the desk of Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has indicated that she supports the idea of such a shield law. The bill stipulates that New York courts and officials will not cooperate if a state with an abortion ban tries to prosecute, sue or otherwise penalize a New York health care provider who offers abortion via telemedicine to a patient in that state, as long as the provider complies with New York law. It passed the State Assembly by a vote of 99 to 45 on Tuesday evening after clearing the Senate by a vote of 39 to 22 last month.Since the Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to an abortion last year, legislation known as telemedicine abortion shield laws have been enacted in Massachusetts, Colorado, Vermont and Washington. But New York’s legislation is expected to have a notable impact. Several providers in New York say they plan to send abortion pills to patients in all restrictive states, and a few providers are speaking publicly, which those in other states with shield laws have so far not done.“I’m going to mail pills as soon as the governor signs the bill,” said Dr. Linda Prine, a New York physician and co-founder of the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline, which answers patients’ questions about medication abortion. “This is the first time we’re able to do something to fight back,” she added.Dr. Prine said she and at least three other doctors would mail pills to patients in all states with restrictions or bans. A telemedicine service in New York, Juniper Midwifery, also said it hoped to use the shield law to mail pills to patients in states with abortion bans.“It’s definitely something that we would want to explore and make it happen,” Jillian Barovick, a midwife and co-founder of Juniper, said.Abortion is now mostly outlawed in 14 states. But most bans penalize people who assist with an abortion, not those who take abortion pills.More than half of abortions in the United States are now carried out with medication, using two drugs, mifepristone followed by misoprostol. Data indicates the process is safe and effective.Abortion opponents are trying to force mifepristone off the market by challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug 23 years ago in a lawsuit expected to be decided by the Supreme Court. The suit also challenges the F.D.A.’s decision in 2021 allowing patients to receive prescribed pills by mail.Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, tens of thousands of patients in states with bans or severe restrictions have taken abortion pills. Many have traveled to states where abortion is legal to obtain pills at clinics or at addresses in those states where pills were sent by mail. But many patients cannot afford the cost and time of traveling.“The telemedicine option and protecting providers who are providing telemedicine abortion services is going to help tremendously the people here in Mississippi and other restricted states,” said Michelle Colón, the executive director of SHERo Mississippi, an organization focused on supporting reproductive rights for people of color. “This will expand access, which we so desperately need.”Other patients receive pills in the mail from overseas, either prescribed by doctors abroad, through a European telemedicine service, or ordered directly from online pharmacies in India or other countries. By the time the pills arrive, often two to three weeks later, patients may be past the 12-week threshold of pregnancy that the World Health Organization endorses for using medication abortion. Mailing pills from within the United States, as doctors operating under shield laws are doing, cuts delivery time to a few days.The telemedicine shield laws are not a guarantee of full legal protection for providers. Under the legislation, if a state with a ban issued an arrest warrant for a physician like Dr. Prine, New York would refuse to extradite her to that state. But if she traveled there, or to another state that agreed to extradite her, she could face criminal charges.“Texas could prosecute them for murder,” said Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general and the architect of a 2021 Texas law that banned abortion after six weeks into pregnancy and deputized private citizens to enforce it by suing for cash judgments of $10,000 per abortion.“Under Texas law, killing a fetus through an illegal abortion is no different from killing a baby, except that the mother cannot be prosecuted (or sued) for death of a fetus,” Mr. Mitchell wrote in an email.Because of the substantial risks, only about 10 health care providers in states with shield laws are known to have begun sending pills to patients in states that restrict abortion. These providers have proceeded cautiously.“Most of the people who have been using the shield laws so far have been just dipping their toes in the water, going to states that maybe aren’t quite as litigious, but I think we just need to start doing it to all of them,” said a doctor in New York’s Hudson Valley who is planning to send pills under the new shield legislation and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the risk involved.Other abortion providers have indicated interest in using shield laws if they could send prescriptions to a pharmacy that would mail the pills rather than stocking and shipping the medications themselves. That option could become available in the coming months if California enacts a telehealth abortion shield bill that passed the state Senate last month. An online pharmacy based in California, Honeybee Health, hopes to use that law to ship to all 50 states, said Jessica Nouhavandi, co-founder and president of Honeybee.“We are anxiously awaiting the passing of the California shield law,” she said.As providers test their states’ telehealth shield laws, many legal questions could arise, including the possibility of civil suits and challenges to a provider’s medical license for unauthorized practice of medicine.“It’s not a matter of if a provider will be challenged in court,” said Rachel Rebouché, the dean of Temple University Law School, who has written in support of shield laws. “It’s a matter of when.”Lawyers on each side of the issue say that state shield laws undermine basic premises of interstate cooperation. Rather than recognizing one state’s arrest warrant or court order, another state effectively throws a wrench into the enforcement of that state’s laws.And a law that shields telehealth abortions disrupts the usual model for telemedicine law and policy, which “presumes that you’re providing care in the place where the patient is,” Professor Rebouché said.To treat a patient in Texas, for example, a New York physician would normally first get a Texas medical license. If the doctor practiced without one, New York would generally help Texas initiate disciplinary proceedings through its medical board. Without the shield law, an out-of-state ruling could have consequences for the doctor’s license in New York.In addition, in some cases, the U.S. Constitution requires states to enforce the civil judgments of another state. An abortion provider in New York could be sued in Texas, for example, by a family member of an abortion patient, claiming damages for wrongful death of the embryo or fetus. If the plaintiff won, the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the Constitution could obligate New York to comply in collecting damages.“It’s very clear that in other states, citizens can still sue doctors who engage in the unlawful practice of medicine,” said Denise Harle, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization that represents the anti-abortion plaintiffs seeking to remove mifepristone from the market in their lawsuit against the F.D.A. “They can sue to protect against bad acts by people who are committing crimes.”Malpractice insurance can also be challenging to arrange. New York’s shield bill, however, says that an insurer cannot drop or penalize a provider who complies with New York law in providing abortions.To date, there have been no known examples of prosecutions, lawsuits or other actions against providers working under telemedicine abortion shield laws. Dr. Prine and others said that they were prepared to be the guinea pigs but that they were also taking steps to protect themselves.Most providers using shield laws say they are avoiding travel to states with abortion bans. Dr. Prine said she would even make sure not to have a flight connection in an airport in a restrictive state.;Many have traveled to states where abortion is legal to obtain pills at clinics or at addresses in those states where pills were sent by mail.Under the legislation, if a state with a ban issued an arrest warrant for a physician like Dr. Prine, New York would refuse to extradite her to that state.That option could become available in the coming months if California enacts a telehealth abortion shield bill that passed the state Senate last month.;2023-06-20T22:51:54+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:02.839380+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60403;Reddit Communities Still Dark As Protest Continues;Users’ anger continued to bubble over changes to the company’s business model.;"Thousands of volunteer-run message boards on Reddit remained dark on Tuesday, a week after moderators of the communities began what they called a 48-hour protest against Reddit’s planned changes to its business model.More than 3,200 message boards, known as subreddits, remained restricted or private, down from nearly 9,000 last week, according to a website tracking the revolt. Others were flooded with memes mocking Reddit’s chief executive, Steve Huffman, as anger continued to bubble on the site over changes to the company’s business model.Moderators of some of the communities that reopened said they had done so after Reddit threatened to replace them.“We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us,” the moderators of the Apple enthusiast forum r/Apple wrote in a message in which they called on Mr. Huffman to resign.Other communities reopened but chose to allow only GIFs, memes and pictures of the host of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” to be posted.The moderators of r/pics, which has 30 million members, for example, took a poll on whether to “return to normal operations” or “only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy.” The Oliver option won decisively, with 37,331 votes to 2,329 for “return to normal.” Many of the memes that flooded the community derided Mr. Huffman.Mr. Oliver encouraged the revolt, posting photos of himself in various get-ups — pink panda-print pajamas, a wizard’s hat with a purple cape — on Twitter, along with the message “Dear Reddit, excellent work. Attn: r/pics — have at it…”The backlash erupted last week over changes that Reddit announced in April when it said it would begin to charge some large-scale companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of memes, GIFs, videos and conversation threads.Reddit said it no longer wanted to give away such a valuable asset to companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, which have been using its data to develop artificial intelligence systems.But some Reddit users and developers said the pricing scheme would kill off popular third-party apps like Apollo, rif is fun for Reddit, ReddPlanet and Sync that people rely on to browse and comment on the site. Moderators said the changes could hurt some of the tools that they use to manage freewheeling discussions on the site.Starting on June 12, many Reddit moderators made their communities “private,” or inaccessible to members, for at least 48 hours. Some users had trouble using the site that day; Reddit said that a “significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues.”A week later, many communities were still up in arms.“You can see there are a lot of subreddits still holding on that have a lot of frustration over how the whole thing has been handled and the unwillingness of Reddit to really give an inch here,” Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an iOS app widely praised for its design and rich features, said in an interview on Tuesday.Mr. Selig said he still planned to shut down the app on June 30, a day before he said he would begin to incur $20 million in annual charges under Reddit’s pricing plan.Despite the turmoil, Mr. Huffman has indicated that Reddit, which is preparing for a possible initial public offering this year, will not change course.He told NBC News last week that Reddit was considering allowing users to vote out moderators who led the protest, comparing them to “landed gentry” who were thwarting the site’s democratic ethos. An estimated 57 million people visit the platform each day.“Protest and dissent is important,” Mr. Huffman told The Associated Press last week. “The problem with this one is it’s not going to change anything because we made a business decision that we’re not negotiating on.”Tim Rathschmidt, a Reddit spokesman, said that, in his reference to “landed gentry,” Mr. Huffman was “talking about how users have been vocal about wanting their communities back open,” and that many moderators and users disagreed with the protest.“In the future, we could look at developing a way for community members to vote out a mod if they disagree with decisions being made that impact the entire community,” Mr. Rathschmidt said in an email on Tuesday.He said, however, that Reddit was not threatening to replace moderators. “That’s not how we operate,” Mr. Rathschmidt said. “Pressuring people is not our goal. We’re communicating expectations and how things work.”Mr. Selig said that developers and moderators were not opposed to Reddit’s charging for access to its data. He said they had asked the company to consider charging less and offering more time before the new prices took effect.Instead, company leaders “walled themselves off and said: ‘You don’t matter. We will just stick through this,’” Mr. Selig said. “And that’s where a lot of the frustration cuts through.”";An estimated 57 million people visit the platform each day.“Protest and dissent is important,” Mr. Huffman told The Associated Press last week.Selig said that developers and moderators were not opposed to Reddit’s charging for access to its data.We will just stick through this,’” Mr. Selig said.;2023-06-20T21:37:20+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:03.325821+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60404;E.U. Takes Aim at China in Proposed Economic Strategy;A European Commission plan seeks to bar companies from sending sensitive high-tech goods to potentially hostile countries — without naming any names.;The European Commission on Tuesday unveiled a new trade doctrine aimed at curbing China’s ability to squeeze Europe’s economy, and at preventing European companies from exporting sensitive, military-linked technology that could give China an edge.The policy, still in its early stages, highlights how the European Union is seeking to align itself with the United States in limiting China’s access to sensitive markets and industrial secrets. It also reflects growing concerns about Beijing’s deepening alliance with Moscow.The announcement in Brussels came in a busy week for Europe-China relations. The Chinese premier, Li Qiang, is visiting Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and business leaders on Tuesday before heading to meetings in France.The initiative also underscores how the European Union, one of the world’s biggest economies and a key trade partner to both China and the United States, is trying to manage its economic dependence on Beijing and avoid the kind of economic breakup with Russia that followed the invasion of Ukraine.The commission, the European Union’s executive branch, said in a 14-page document that poor coordination among the member states and weak trade rules could allow adversaries to have an economic chokehold over E.U. economies or manufacturers, and needed to be urgently addressed.“More than ever our national security is deeply intertwined with our ability to be economically safe and resilient,” the paper said.The document didn’t once mention China, or any specific countries, but rather made reference to “destinations of concern that operate civil-military fusion strategies.”Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in comments to reporters that the policy was “country agnostic” and wasn’t aimed at overhauling how the bloc engaged with economic powers. Rather, she said, “we’re looking at a limited, small set of cutting-edge technologies,” adding: “And here, we want to make sure that they do not enhance the military capacities of some countries of concern.”But European diplomats said the proposed economic strategy was clearly about China. They said it would probably take several months of debate before it became concrete policy but was an essential first step toward preventing economic goals from undermining the European Union’s security.Still, diplomats said the bloc’s biggest economic powers — Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands — were not eager for what could be disruptive intervention from Brussels in their critical economic relationships with China. Those concerns could set the scene for a watering-down of the commission’s proposals.The meetings in Germany on Tuesday were muted and avoided the elephant in the room: the German economy’s dependence on China. More than a million German jobs depend directly on China, and almost half of German manufacturers rely on China for some part of their supply chain.After their meeting at the chancellery, Mr. Scholz and Mr. Li read statements but took no questions.“Direct dialogue, personal conversation, real exchange — all this is even more important than usual in this extraordinary time full of global challenges and crises,” Mr. Scholz said, skirting thorny issues and choosing instead to focus on climate and green energy.“We have no interest in economic decoupling from China,” he said. Mr. Scholz also avoided mentioning de-risking economic relations with China — a milder approach to easing dependence that has quickly gained traction in diplomatic parlance.Mr. Li, however, did bring up the term later in the day. “Imposing discriminatory measures in the name of de-risking to restrict or exclude other countries is contrary to market principles as well as the rules of fair competition and the rules of the World Trade Organization,” he said, according to the DPA, a German news service.The European Commission proposal on economic security said the bloc should keep potentially hostile countries and their companies out of certain critical infrastructure, such as ports and pipelines, and bar European Union companies from exporting high-tech goods with military uses to potential adversaries.The document also aims to ensure that supply chains for security-sensitive goods are not overly dependent on such countries, and to stop proprietary European technologies in artificial intelligence, chip-making or biotechnology from “leaking.”The bloc already has a set of rules that seek to address some of these concerns, but the commission said that much better and stricter rules were needed, and that they should be applied with the same zest and standards across the 27 nations. The goal, the document said, is to make sure that there are no back doors to undermining European security.“The need for more rapid and coordinated action at E.U. level in the area of export controls has become pressing,” the proposal said, noting that “an uncoordinated proliferation of national controls by member states would create loopholes.”Some European countries have already tightened their trade relations with China, with the Netherlands this year barring the firm ASML from exporting its advanced chip production technology there on security grounds.The bloc is also considering targeting Chinese companies with sanctions because they are providing Russia with chips used in weapons deployed against Ukraine.Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting from Berlin.;It also reflects growing concerns about Beijing’s deepening alliance with Moscow.The announcement in Brussels came in a busy week for Europe-China relations.Mr. Scholz also avoided mentioning de-risking economic relations with China — a milder approach to easing dependence that has quickly gained traction in diplomatic parlance.Mr.The goal, the document said, is to make sure that there are no back doors to undermining European security.“The need for more rapid and coordinated action at E.U.;2023-06-20T17:58:07+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:03.817810+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60405;U.K. Moves to Use Frozen Russian Assets to Help Ukraine Rebuild;The government’s announcement follows a pledge made by Group of 7 nations at their annual gathering last month to freeze Russian assets until Moscow pays for the damage done in Ukraine.;As Russia’s ruinous attacks on Ukraine mount, Britain’s government is proposing legislation that would enable it to divert frozen Russian assets to the rebuilding of Ukraine and keep sanctions in place until Moscow pays compensation to its war-torn neighbor.The British announcement is in line with a decision last month at the annual Group of 7 meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, to freeze the estimated $300 billion worth of Russian assets held by banks and financial institutions in those countries — including Britain — “until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.”The issue of seized assets is highly contentious. While governments have the power to freeze assets, the European Central Bank has privately warned Brussels that confiscating Russian funds or giving the earned interest on those accounts to Ukraine could undermine confidence in the euro and shake financial stability, according to a report in The Financial Times. Investors might be reluctant to use euros as a reserve currency if they fear their funds could be grabbed.Ukraine’s reconstruction costs are estimated to top $411 billion, according to the most recent numbers from the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations. The ravaged landscape of the eastern city of Bakhmut, which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine laid out at the G7 meeting, is just one sign of the damage. “You have to understand that there is nothing,” Mr. Zelensky told reporters. “They’ve destroyed everything. There are no buildings.”The bank’s estimate was calculated before the vast devastation unleashed by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine this month.Calls to seize Russian assets and use them for Ukraine’s reconstruction have increased as the war has stretched well into its second year. Last week, the United States Senate introduced a bipartisan bill to confiscate Russian assets and use them for Ukraine’s reconstruction. And the issue is also expected to come up at a Ukraine Recovery Conference being held in London on Wednesday and Thursday.Since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine early last year, Britain has frozen roughly $23 billion in assets and imposed sanctions on 1,550 individuals. The government’s latest proposal will require people under sanctions to disclose their holdings in Britain.“Through our new measures today, we’re strengthening the U.K.’s sanctions approach,” James Cleverly, Britain’s foreign secretary, said in a statement on Monday accompanying the announcement, “affirming that the U.K. is prepared to use sanctions to ensure Russia pays to repair the country it has so recklessly attacked.”;The ravaged landscape of the eastern city of Bakhmut, which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine laid out at the G7 meeting, is just one sign of the damage.“You have to understand that there is nothing,” Mr. Zelensky told reporters.Last week, the United States Senate introduced a bipartisan bill to confiscate Russian assets and use them for Ukraine’s reconstruction.;2023-06-20T13:22:45+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:04.282151+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60406;What Businesses Can Learn from Antony Blinken’s China Trip;The secretary of state’s talks with Xi Jinping raised hopes that the world’s two biggest economies might stabilize relations, but the big challenges were not resolved.;"Worries about China’s economic recovery sent stocks and U.S. futures lower on Tuesday morning, despite a promising meeting on Monday between the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Beijing.The discussions raised hopes that the world’s two biggest economies might stabilize relations, but the market reaction points at the deeper challenges for policymakers and business.The mood music was positive. Xi said the two sides had “made progress” and President Biden told reporters in California that Blinken had done “a hell of a job.” But that just talking generated such excitement is a sign of how tense relations have become. There was no agreement or detail on the most contentious issues: restrictions on Chinese access to advanced technologies; accusations that the U.S. and its allies want to contain Beijing’s ambitions; Taiwan; the war in Ukraine.“Distrust remains high,” said Noah Barkin, a specialist on China relations at the research firm Rhodium Group. “For international investors, this is not enough to trigger any sort of rethink with regard to the Chinese market.” The Biden administration, he said, would continue screening strategic investments into China and Beijing showed no signs of easing pressure on foreign firms operating in the country.Business is de-risking rather than decoupling. Raytheon’s C.E.O., Greg Hayes, said it was “impossible” to break away entirely from China because of the complexity of supply chains and the level of U.S. trade with the country, while the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is reportedly looking to spin off its China unit, according to The Financial Times.China has big domestic concerns, too. The country’s central bank cut its prime lending rate today and Goldman Sachs lowered its growth outlook for the country over the weekend. “For business, the issue is not so much China-U.S. relations per se, but the very worrying state of the Chinese economy at present. Awareness of how challenged that is was probably one of the main issues that created a more communicative China, one that is willing to show just a bit of compromise at the moment,” said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London and a former British diplomat in Beijing.Yu Jie, a China expert at Chatham House, a British think-tank, added that Xi still hoped “that Western business could be part of his plan to generate much-needed growth and employment.”What to watch next?

Coast Guard officials estimated that the Titan submersible, which disappeared Sunday morning, theoretically had between 70 to 96 hours of air as of late yesterday afternoon.

60407;Final Fantasy XVI Takes on Its ‘Star Wars’ Problem;Square Enix is trying to make a role-playing game for old fans and new gamers alike, a precarious tightrope for aging franchises.;"Whenever a new Final Fantasy arrives, fans of the role-playing video games that became famous in the 1990s for using the medium to tell deep, epic stories with large, diverse casts hope that this will be the one to make the franchise relevant again.Entries from the past decade and a half have missed the mark. The most recent installment — Final Fantasy XV, released seven years ago — was a letdown for many, with a disjointed story line and forgettable characters. Even its makers won’t defend it.Square Enix, the studio behind the 35-year-old franchise, is trying to right some wrongs with the release of Final Fantasy XVI for the PlayStation 5 on June 22. But like those in charge of other aging entertainment properties, such as Star Wars, the studio is walking a precarious tightrope of trying to satisfy the expectations of a dedicated fan base while attracting new audiences.For Final Fantasy XVI, that means a departure from characteristics that have been fundamental to every game in the main series, including the ability to manage an extensive party of characters and the quirky, whimsical tone.Now, players will control only one character, adopting the structure of successful role-playing games like The Witcher and God of War. And in the ambition to tell a story that rivals “Game of Thrones,” it is the first installment to be rated “M” for mature because of its gory violence and gratuitous use of obscenities.Square Enix says the game will pay special attention to the narrative of Clive Rosfield, a prince seeking vengeance after the destruction of his kingdom and the slaying of his brother. Players will follow the new character from adolescence to adulthood to understand his motivations and eventual transformation.“We wanted to restore the faith in the Final Fantasy series by going back to those roots and putting the focus on the story — and trying to make up for what happened during Final Fantasy XV,” Naoki Yoshida, the producer of Final Fantasy XVI, said through an interpreter in a recent video call.Final Fantasy XV left embarrassing scars on Square Enix because of its confusing story. Key plot points were left unexplained in part because of the decision to distribute narrative details across an animated movie and an anime series. Some downloadable content that was meant to expand the background of important characters was canceled altogether.But it remains an open question whether Final Fantasy XVI’s renewed focus on story substance will resonate with gamers.If Square Enix goes too far in the direction of serving nostalgic fans, it risks creating the perception that Final Fantasy is out of touch with current gaming trends; if it focuses too much on new audiences, it could be scrutinized for abandoning its roots. Trying to please both groups — as it attempted with Final Fantasy XV, which got solid reviews overall because of its high production values — could land it safely somewhere in the middle, the plane of creative mediocrity.Star Wars viewers saw a similar dynamic play out in the most recent trilogy. Though critics hailed its second episode, “The Last Jedi,” for offering a fresh take on the space opera by suggesting that any average person could be a Jedi, franchise loyalists abhorred it for breaking the sacred canon. In response to the backlash, those violations were reversed in “The Rise of Skywalker,” one of the most harshly reviewed Star Wars movies of all time.Final Fantasy’s most defining original gameplay feature — the turn-based battle system, where players toggled through a party of characters and selected an action like casting a magic spell on an enemy — was laid to rest more than 15 years ago.Although some people still prefer that system, Yoshida said, gamers — and he is no exception — had come to expect fast-paced action as consoles became increasingly powerful.Final Fantasy XVI will also take on a strikingly darker tone than past installments that were more lighthearted and accessible, even to children. The game opens with the invasion of the protagonist’s kingdom and the brutal slaughtering of his family. Yoshida said he took this direction to reflect the harsh climate of our times.“By showing the bad, it accentuates the good that is out there and makes it feel more real,” he said. “But you know, at its core, Final Fantasy XVI is also a story about love, and it’s a story about hope.”Yoshida said the decision to focus on one character in Final Fantasy XVI was driven largely by its modern battle design. Players who control Clive must rely on their timing and reflexes to attack and dodge opponents. Adding more characters to the party would have required the player to learn multiple skill sets, which Yoshida said would have made the game too complicated.Narratives centered on a single character often conform to Joseph Campbell’s concept of the hero’s journey, where someone ventures into the unknown, overcomes a crisis and returns transformed. That formula has produced Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter as well as video game heroes like Link in The Legend of Zelda and Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.Even so, that structure can constrain game designers, said Souvik Mukherjee, an assistant professor of cultural studies who leads research on video games as a storytelling medium at the Center for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata, India. Because the camera remains largely fixed on the protagonist, other characters the player encounters seem to exist only to aid the hero.Some games using that approach have found ways to tell compelling stories, said Mukherjee, who pointed to Red Dead Redemption 2’s tale of the gang member Arthur Morgan and his deteriorating relationship with the group’s leader, Dutch van der Linde.Square Enix, however, could struggle to pull off a similar feat. The stories in some of its biggest hits, like Final Fantasy VI (1994) and Final Fantasy VII (1997, which was rebooted in 2020), were unveiled through the perspectives of multiple characters and intersecting narratives.The first few hours of Final Fantasy XVI illustrate the game’s efforts to tell a complex story involving multiple kingdoms at war. The game will test whether Clive’s solo journey, where he encounters some allies but is mostly accompanied only by his dog, will be a successful storytelling mechanism for this narrative.The series has also had a rich history of portraying strong women, such as Final Fantasy X’s Yuna, a summoner determined to banish an evil monster, and Final Fantasy VII’s Tifa Lockhart, a childhood friend who saves that game’s protagonist, Cloud Strife, from a mental breakdown.The fate of women is another reason Final Fantasy XV bothered fans, said Brianna Wu, a video game developer and a longtime fan of the franchise. The game gave little airtime to the protagonist’s fiancée, Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, before killing her off, and hypersexualized Cindy Aurum, a mechanic who was constantly revealing cleavage.“As a gamer who loves Final Fantasy for the powerful women, I feel like they’ve really been on the wrong track for a long time from a representation point of view,” she said. “Clive looks interesting, but I’m really waiting to see what they do with their women.”Yoshida, the Square Enix producer, said Final Fantasy XVI’s story would resonate with gamers across generations. By following Clive from youth to adulthood, he said, the story line will be relatable to younger players just stepping into the real world and older gamers who have seen what the real world is like.Perhaps more important is whether Clive’s story will turn a fading franchise into the influential game it once was.";The most recent installment — Final Fantasy XV, released seven years ago — was a letdown for many, with a disjointed story line and forgettable characters.Key plot points were left unexplained in part because of the decision to distribute narrative details across an animated movie and an anime series.The game opens with the invasion of the protagonist’s kingdom and the brutal slaughtering of his family.;2023-06-20T09:01:36+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:05.347293+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60408;China’s Economic Rebound Hits a Wall, With ‘No Quick Fix’ to Revive It;Policymakers and investors expected China’s economy to rev up again after Beijing abruptly dropped Covid precautions, but recent data shows alarming signs of a slowdown.;When China suddenly dismantled its lockdowns and other Covid precautions last December, officials in Beijing and many investors expected the economy to spring back to life.It has not worked out that way.Investment in China has stagnated this spring after a flurry of activity in late winter. Exports are shrinking. Fewer and fewer new housing projects are being started. Prices are falling. More than one in five young people is unemployed.China has tried many fixes over the last few years when its economy had flagged, like heavy borrowing to pay for roads and rail lines. And it spent huge sums on testing and quarantines during the pandemic. Extra stimulus spending now with borrowed money would spur a burst of activity but pose a difficult choice for policymakers already worried about the accumulated debt.“Authorities risk being behind the curve in stimulating the economy, but there’s no quick fix,” said Louise Loo, an economist specializing in China in the Singapore office of Oxford Economics.China needs to right its economy after closing itself off to the world for almost three years to battle Covid, a decision that prompted many companies to begin shifting their supply chains elsewhere. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, met on Monday with the secretary of state of the United States, Antony J. Blinken, in an attempt by the two nations to lower diplomatic tensions and clear the way for high-level economic talks in the weeks ahead. Such discussions could slow the recent proliferation of sanctions and counter measures.China’s halting economic recovery has seen only a few categories of spending grow robustly, like travel and restaurant meals. And those have increased in comparison with extremely low levels in spring 2022, when a two-month lockdown in Shanghai disrupted economic activity across large areas of central China.The economy has been particularly weak in recent weeks.“From April to May to now, the economy has experienced significant unexpected changes, to the point where some people believe that the initial judgments may have been overly optimistic,” Yin Yanlin, a former deputy director of the Chinese Communist Party’s top economic policymaking commission, said in a speech at an academic conference on Saturday.Chinese government officials have been dropping hints that an economic stimulus plan may be imminent.“In response to the changes in the economic situation, more forceful measures must be taken to enhance the momentum of development, optimize the economic structure, and promote the continuous recovery of the economy,” the country’s State Council, or cabinet, said after a meeting on Friday led by Li Qiang, the country’s new premier.China’s economic weakness holds benefits and dangers for the global economy. Consumer and producer prices have fallen for the past four months in China, putting a brake on inflation in the West by pushing down the cost of imports from China.But weak demand in China may exacerbate a global slowdown. Europe already dipped into a mild recession early this year. Rapid interest rate increases in the United States have prompted some investors to bet on a recession late this year there as well.Beijing has already taken some steps to revitalize economic growth. Tax breaks are being introduced for small businesses. Interest rates on bank deposits have been reduced to encourage households to spend more of their money instead of saving it. The latest government measure was announced on Tuesday, when the state-controlled banking system reduced its benchmark interest rates for corporate loans and home mortgages.But many economists, inside and outside China, worry about the effectiveness of the new measures.Consumers are hoarding cash and investors are wary of putting money into China’s companies. Private investment has actually declined so far this year compared with 2022. Housing remains in crisis, with developers borrowing more to pay existing debts and to complete existing projects, even as China already suffers from an oversupply of homes.China’s housing market stands at the heart of its troubles. Construction has accounted for as much as a quarter of China’s economic output. But would-be homeowners have been put off as developers have defaulted on their debts and failed to finish apartments buyers had paid for in advance.Housing construction has fallen nearly 23 percent in the first five months of the year, compared with the same months last year. That suggests the real estate sector has further to fall in the coming months.Chen Leiqian, a 27-year-old marketer in Beijing, started looking for an apartment with her boyfriend in 2021 after five years of dating. But they then decided to stay put in a rental apartment when they married.“Housing prices across the country are falling, and the economy is very bad — there are just too many unstable elements,” Ms. Chen said.Two-thirds of Ms. Chen’s co-workers in her department at an online tutoring company were laid off after China cracked down on the for-profit, private education industry in 2021. She also had a friend who could no longer pay a mortgage after losing a job in the tech sector, and lost the home in foreclosure.The caution of middle-class families like Ms. Chen’s may pose the biggest dilemma for policymakers as they search for an effective formula for another round of economic stimulus.“You can throw money on people but if they are not confident, they will not spend,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, a French bank.Households are not alone in struggling to pay their debts — so are local governments, which has limited their ability to step up infrastructure spending.The government is wary of starting another credit binge of the sort seen in 2009, during the global financial collapse, and in 2016, after China’s stock market plunged the preceding year.Although the sagging real estate sector has hurt demand inside China, exports have been flat this year and actually declined in May. The weakness of China’s normally powerful exports is particularly noteworthy because Beijing has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to lose about 7 percent of its value against the dollar since mid-January. A weaker renminbi makes Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets.More exports help create jobs and could compensate for the otherwise slack domestic economy. But it’s not clear how much China will be able to count on exports to help as some of China’s biggest trading partners have moved some purchases to other countries in Asia.In the United States, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on a wide range of Chinese industrial goods, making it more expensive for American companies to buy from China. Then President Biden persuaded Congress last year to authorize broad subsidies for American production in categories like electric cars and solar panels. China’s exports to the United States were down 18.2 percent last month compared with May last year.Now as China considers how to reinforce the economy, it must contend with a loss of confidence among consumers.Charles Wang runs a small travel company with eight employees in Zhangjiakou, in northern China. His business has almost fully rebounded after the pandemic but he has no plans to invest in expansion.“Our economy is actually going down, and everyone doesn’t have so much time and willingness to spend,” Mr. Wang said. “It’s because people just don’t want to spend money — everyone is afraid again, even the rich.”Li You contributed research.;Construction has accounted for as much as a quarter of China’s economic output.A weaker renminbi makes Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets.More exports help create jobs and could compensate for the otherwise slack domestic economy.Then President Biden persuaded Congress last year to authorize broad subsidies for American production in categories like electric cars and solar panels.;2023-06-20T02:52:15+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:05.965849+00:00;453;Business;1267;The Funny Times
60447;Few of Trump’s G.O.P. Rivals Defend Justice Dept. Independence;The evolution of the Republican Party under the influence of former President Donald J. Trump calls into question a post-Watergate norm.;"Donald J. Trump has promised that if he wins back the presidency he will appoint a special prosecutor to “go after” President Biden and his family.But he’s not the only Republican running for president who appears to be abandoning a long-established norm in Washington — presidents keeping their hands out of specific Justice Department investigations and prosecutions.Mr. Trump, who leads the G.O.P. field by around 30 percentage points in public national polls, wields such powerful influence that only a few of his Republican rivals are willing to clearly say presidents should not interfere in such Justice Department decisions.After Mr. Trump’s vow to direct the Justice Department to appoint a “real” prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, The New York Times asked each of his Republican rivals questions aimed at laying out what limits, if any, they believed presidents must or should respect when it comes to White House interference with federal law enforcement decisions.Their responses reveal a party that has turned so hard against federal law enforcement that it is no longer widely considered good politics to clearly answer in the negative a question that was once uncontroversial: Do you believe presidents should get involved in the investigations and prosecutions of individuals?Mr. Trump’s closest rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, has flatly said he does not believe the Justice Department is independent from the White House as a matter of law, while leaving it ambiguous where he stands on the issue of presidents getting involved in investigation decisions.Mr. DeSantis’s spokesman, Bryan Griffin, wrote in an email that comments the governor made on a recent policy call “should be instructive to your reporting.”In the comments, Mr. DeSantis says that “the fundamental insight” he gleans from the Constitution is that the Justice Department and F.B.I. are not “independent” from the White House and that the president can lawfully exert more direct control over them than traditionally has been the case.“I think presidents have bought into this canard that they’re independent, and that’s one of the reasons why they’ve accumulated so much power over the years,” Mr. DeSantis said. “We will use the lawful authority that we have.”But the context of Mr. DeSantis’s remarks was mostly about a president firing political appointees and bureaucrats at the Justice Department and the F.B.I., not about a president ordering them to target specific people with investigations and prosecutions. Mr. Griffin did not respond when asked in a follow-up on this point.Mr. Trump has portrayed his legal troubles as stemming from politicization, although there is no evidence Mr. Biden directed Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Mr. Trump. Under Mr. Garland, Trump-appointed prosecutors are already investigating Mr. Biden’s handling of classified documents and on Tuesday secured a guilty plea from Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter, on tax charges.Especially since Watergate, there has been an institutional tradition of Justice Department independence from White House control. The idea is that while a president can set broad policies — directing the Justice Department to put greater resources and emphasis on particular types of crimes, for example — he or she should not get involved in specific criminal case decisions except in rare cases affecting foreign policy.This is particularly seen as true for cases involving a president’s personal or political interests, such as an investigation into himself or his political opponents.But even in his first term, Mr. Trump increasingly pressed against that notion.In the spring of 2018, Mr. Trump told his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that he wanted to order the Justice Department to investigate his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, and James B. Comey Jr., the former head of the F.B.I. Mr. McGahn rebuffed him, saying the president had no authority to order an investigation, according to two people familiar with the conversation.Later in 2018, Mr. Trump publicly demanded that the Justice Department open an investigation into officials involved in the Russia investigation. The following year, Attorney General William P. Barr indeed assigned a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, John Durham, to investigate the investigators — styling it as an administrative review because there was no factual predicate to open a formal criminal investigation.Mr. Trump also said in 2018 and 2019 that John F. Kerry, the Obama-era secretary of state, should be prosecuted for illegally interfering with American diplomacy by seeking to preserve a nuclear accord with Iran. Geoffrey S. Berman, a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan whom Mr. Trump fired in 2020, later wrote in his memoir that the Trump Justice Department pressured him to find a way to charge Mr. Kerry, but he closed the investigation after about a year without bringing any charges.And as the 2020 election neared, Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Barr and Mr. Durham to file charges against high-level former officials even though the prosecutor had not found a factual basis to justify any. In his own memoir, Mr. Barr wrote that the Durham investigation’s “failure to deliver scalps in time for the election” eroded their relationship even before Mr. Barr refused Mr. Trump’s baseless demand that he say the 2020 election had been corrupt.Where Mr. Trump’s first-term efforts were scattered and haphazard, key allies — including Jeffrey B. Clark, a former Justice Department official who helped Mr. Trump try to overturn the 2020 election — have been developing a blueprint to make the department in any second Trump term more systematically subject to direct White House control.Against that backdrop, Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the long-shot G.O.P. challengers, has pledged to pardon Mr. Trump if Mr. Ramaswamy wins the presidency. He said that as a constitutional matter, he thinks a president does have the power to direct prosecutors to open or close specific criminal investigations. But he added that “the president must exercise this judgment with prudence in a manner that respects the rule of law in the country.”Asked if he would pledge, regardless of his views on what the law may technically allow presidents to do, to obey the post-Watergate norm, Mr. Ramaswamy replied: “As a general norm, yes.”Two Republican candidates who are both former U.S. attorneys unequivocally stated that presidents should not direct the investigations or prosecutions of individuals. Tellingly, both are chasing votes from anti-Trump moderate Republicans.Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor who was a U.S. attorney in the George W. Bush administration, said he knew “just how important it is to keep prosecutors independent and let them do their jobs.”“No president should be meddling in Department of Justice investigations or cases in any way,” Mr. Christie added. “The best way to keep that from happening is with a strong attorney general who can lead without fear or favor.”And Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor and congressman who served as a U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration, said that “preserving an independent and politically impartial Department of Justice in terms of specific investigations is essential for the rule of law and paramount in rebuilding trust with the American people.”A spokesman for former Vice President Mike Pence, Devin O’Malley, was terse. He said a president could remove senior law enforcement officials and expressed some support for Justice Department independence. But he declined to add further comment when pressed.“Mike Pence believes that the president of the United States has the ability to hire and fire the attorney general, the F.B.I. director, and other D.O.J. officials — and has, in fact, pledged to do so if elected — but also believes the D.O.J. has a certain level of independence with regard to prosecutorial matters,” Mr. O’Malley said.Most other candidates running against Mr. Trump landed in what they apparently deemed to be a politically safer space of blending general comments about how justice should be administered impartially with vague accusations that the Biden-era Justice Department had targeted Republicans for political reasons.Many did not specifically point to a basis for those accusations. Among a broad swath of conservatives, it is taken as a given that the F.B.I. and Justice Department must be politically motivated against them on a variety of fronts, including the scrutiny over the 2016 Trump campaign’s links to Russia, the prosecution of people who rioted at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the Trump documents case.Matt Gorman, a senior communications adviser for Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined to say whether or not Mr. Scott believed presidents should interfere in specific investigations. He pointed only to Mr. Scott’s comments on the most recent “Fox News Sunday” appearance.In those remarks, Mr. Scott said: “We have to clean out the political appointments in the Department of Justice to restore confidence and integrity in the D.O.J. Today, we want to know that in our justice system, Lady Justice wears a blindfold and that all Americans will be treated fairly by Lady Justice. But today, this D.O.J. continues to hunt Republicans while they protect Democrats.”Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, also provided an ambiguous answer through her spokeswoman, Chaney Denton. She pointed to two specific conservative grievances with law enforcement: Seven years ago, Hillary Clinton was not charged over using a private email server while secretary of state, and the Trump-era special counsel, Mr. Durham, wrote a report this year criticizing the Russia inquiry.“The Department of Justice should be impartial, but unfortunately it is not today,” Ms. Denton said. “The Durham Report, the non-prosecution of Hillary Clinton, and other actions make it clear that a partisan double standard is being applied. The answer is not to have both parties weaponize the Justice Department; it’s to have neither side do it.”When specifically pressed, Ms. Denton declined to say whether Ms. Haley believes presidents should get involved in prosecutions or investigations of individuals.One recent entrant to the race, Mayor Francis X. Suarez of Miami, disavowed the post-Watergate norm, putting forward a premise that law enforcement officials are currently politically biased and so his White House interference would be to correct that purported state of affairs.“I certainly would not promise that I would allow a biased department operate independently,” he said in part of a statement. “I believe it is the president’s responsibility to insist that justice is delivered fairly without bias or political influence.”A spokesman for Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, Lance Trover, was even more vague.“Gov. Burgum believes that citizens’ faith in our institutions is the foundation of a free and just society and will not allow them to be a political enforcement extension of the party in power as we have seen in failed countries,” he said. “If Americans have distrust in the Justice Department when he takes office, he will do what it takes to restore the American people’s faith in the Department of Justice and other bedrocks of our democracy.”";Trump has portrayed his legal troubles as stemming from politicization, although there is no evidence Mr. Biden directed Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Mr. Trump.He said a president could remove senior law enforcement officials and expressed some support for Justice Department independence.Today, we want to know that in our justice system, Lady Justice wears a blindfold and that all Americans will be treated fairly by Lady Justice.;2023-06-21T09:00:39+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:25.922962+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60448;For Biden, the Troubles of His Son Are Personal and Politically Painful;Hunter Biden’s plea agreement put him in the cross-hairs of President Biden’s adversaries once again.;After more than a half-century in politics, no subject may be more personally painful nor politically problematic for President Biden than his troubled son, Hunter. He is by various accounts a gaping wound in his heart and the most sensitive soft spot in his campaign armor.On the one hand, Hunter Biden’s agreement on Tuesday to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax crimes capped a five-year investigation without allegations of wrongdoing by the president or, presumably, prison time for his youngest son. But on the other hand, it put Hunter once again in the cross-hairs of Mr. Biden’s adversaries who instantly complained that the wayward son got off too easy.The saga of the 53-year-old presidential progeny who has struggled with a crack cocaine addiction has become a fixation of the political right, which sees him, or at least has cast him, as a walking, talking exemplar of the pay-to-play culture of the Washington swamp who profited off proximity to power. The phrase “Hunter Biden’s laptop” has taken on totemic meaning for opponents of the president, even if they cannot describe what was actually found on the computer that turned up at a repair shop in 2020.The timing of the younger Mr. Biden’s plea agreement, coming nearly two weeks after the indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on 37 felony counts of jeopardizing national security and obstructing justice, invariably generated comparisons between two vastly different cases. The president’s allies pointed to the plea deal as evidence that Mr. Biden was playing it straight by letting a prosecutor first appointed by Mr. Trump decide how to handle his son’s misconduct, while the former president and his backers characterized it as proof of selective justice.“The corrupt Biden DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere ‘traffic ticket,’” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform. “Slap on the wrist” became the phrase of choice for Republicans like Representatives James R. Comer of Kentucky and Elise Stefanik of New York.David Brock, a Democratic operative, said the outcome of the prosecution refuted the many allegations hurled at the president and his son since the Trump administration. “Hunter will not be charged with any of the unfounded and outlandish issues Republicans and right-wing media have used to smear him with for years,” Mr. Brock said.It is a debate Mr. Biden would just as soon not engage in and he stayed largely quiet in the hours after news of the plea agreement broke, authorizing a White House spokesman to say only that he and the first lady “love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life.”Asked by reporters traveling with him in California whether he had spoken with Hunter on Tuesday, the president said simply, “I’m very proud of my son.”Mr. Biden understands that the plea deal will not be the end of the matter as House Republicans aggressively conduct their own inquiries and publicize more sensational accusations that, even without confirmation, have become a staple of conservative media.But after months of waiting in frustration for the case to be resolved, Mr. Biden was relieved to have the plea agreement settled, hoping it would lift an enormous burden from his son’s shoulders without triggering a relapse of his addiction problems, according to people close to him. Mr. Biden has remained publicly silent not out of fear of political blowback, the people said, but out of concern of inflicting more torment on his son.“I don’t know of any parent who wants to see their son or family’s personal or legal struggle play out so publicly for all the world to see,” said Michael LaRosa, a former spokesman for Jill Biden. “In the three years I worked for them on the campaign and in the White House, they never became immune to the personal assault on their family. Every smear, attack, conspiracy and lie about their son is painful and never gets old.”Troubled and troublesome relatives have been a perennial White House headache for many presidents. In modern times, the harsh spotlight of media scrutiny has focused on Donald Nixon’s financial dealings with Howard Hughes, Billy Carter’s work as an agent for Libya, Neil Bush’s service on the board of a failed savings and loan, Roger Clinton’s drug convictions and of course the various financial and security clearance issues involving Mr. Trump’s children and son-in-law.For the most part, the presidents sought to remain removed from their relatives’ problems, although Bill Clinton did give his half brother a pardon just before leaving office. How much any of those issues hurt the presidents politically may be up for debate, but at home they were generally a source of anguish — either irritation at a loved one for causing problems or guilt at putting a target on the back of family members, or both.Hunter Biden has become in some ways a more extreme example of the phenomenon in an era when any restraint about a president’s family that might have existed in the past has long since vanished. His work in Ukraine helped lead to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, his laptop led to allegations that Twitter covered up on his behalf, his foreign financial ties have prompted sprawling congressional investigations and his turbulent personal life has produced much tabloid fodder.Many Americans have been persuaded that the president’s son has been up to something shady beyond the tax and gun charges at issue on Tuesday. A Harris Poll conducted last month for Harvard’s Center for American Political Studies found that 63 percent of Americans think Hunter Biden was involved in “illegal influence peddling,” and 53 percent said his father was somehow involved while vice president.Even some of the president’s Democratic allies have privately said there were legitimate questions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and China that seemed to trade on his name. Even as they emphasized that there was no evidence that his father abused his power in office as a result, they lamented that Mr. Biden had not done more to rein in his son’s lucrative activities.Even so, none of those produced charges in Tuesday’s deal, and the fact that it was brokered by David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney who was first appointed by Mr. Trump’s attorney general to investigate and was allowed to stay on the case by Mr. Biden’s Justice Department, provided a useful rejoinder to allegations of favoritism. Mr. Weiss told Congress that he was granted “ultimate authority over this matter.”Democratic strategists doubted the issue would resonate with swing voters regardless. “The Republicans have been all in on and constantly beating the Hunter Biden drum and while it certainly riles up their base, there isn’t much evidence that the average voter feels impacted by this issue,” said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked for President Barack Obama.For the president, though, it is much more personal. His relationship with his son was forged in the 1972 car accident that killed Mr. Biden’s first wife and infant daughter and hospitalized Hunter and his older brother, Beau.While Beau grew up to become a successful politician who his father imagined might become president himself one day, Hunter struggled with alcohol, drugs and personal issues. After Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, a distraught Hunter spiraled into repeated bouts with crack cocaine that ultimately destroyed his marriage.As he wrote in “Beautiful Things,” his 2021 memoir, he would descend into weekslong drug binges, smoking crack as often as every 15 minutes and engaging in erratic and even reckless behavior, including inviting his street dealer to live with him and conducting an extramarital affair with Beau’s widow, Hallie Biden. He described a life of “buying crack in the middle of the night behind a gas station in Nashville, Tenn., or craving the tiny liquor bottles in your hotel minibar while sitting in a palace in Amman with the king of Jordan.”At one point when he disappeared for nearly a month, he opened his door to find his father, then the vice president, trailed by Secret Service agents. “You need help,” his father said. As Hunter Biden wrote, “He wouldn’t leave until I agreed to do something.” On another occasion the elder Mr. Biden participated in a family intervention, ambushing Hunter to push him into treatment. When Hunter stormed out in anger, his father chased him down the driveway, grabbed him and cried.Hunter Biden has since remarried, paid the tax debt that led to Tuesday’s charges and said he had turned his life around. Friends of the family said he had demonstrated fortitude.“Hunter has had the character to recover from his addiction and partisan political attacks to sign this settlement and begin the rest of his life,” said former Senator Ted Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware and a longtime adviser to Mr. Biden.Still, Hunter Biden faces a civil trial in Arkansas next month in a dispute over child support payments to a woman who in 2018 bore a daughter that he denied was his until DNA proved his paternity — a case that Republicans made sure to highlight on Tuesday.The younger Mr. Biden only occasionally shows up at public White House events, knowing that whenever he does it will become an issue. He attended a state dinner at the White House in December and traveled with his father to Ireland in April.But regardless of whether he is there in person, Hunter Biden will continue to be a presence in his father’s presidency, welcome or not, especially as next year’s election draws closer.;After more than a half-century in politics, no subject may be more personally painful nor politically problematic for President Biden than his troubled son, Hunter.“In the three years I worked for them on the campaign and in the White House, they never became immune to the personal assault on their family.Every smear, attack, conspiracy and lie about their son is painful and never gets old.”Troubled and troublesome relatives have been a perennial White House headache for many presidents.;2023-06-21T03:24:19+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:26.447750+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60450;Garland’s Distance From Hunter Biden Inquiry Fails to Quell Critics;The attorney general has confronted an unrelenting succession of politically sensitive investigations, underlining the intensely polarized environment he is operating in.;Attorney General Merrick B. Garland was 4,000 miles away from Delaware on Tuesday when federal prosecutors announced a deal for Hunter Biden on tax and gun charges that would most likely ensure he does not serve a prison sentence.It reflected the distance Mr. Garland has sought from the investigation into his boss’s son.Mr. Garland’s aides say his trip to Europe had been weeks in the making, and his absence from the country was happenstance, not calculation. But his two-day visit to Stockholm and The Hague was nonetheless fitting for an attorney general who has taken great pains to emphasize his removal from the day-to-day oversight of high-stakes investigations of former President Donald J. Trump, President Biden and Mr. Biden’s troubled youngest son.The investigation into Hunter Biden predates Mr. Garland’s appointment. It was initiated by the Justice Department under Mr. Trump in 2018 and placed under the U.S. attorney in Delaware, David C. Weiss, one of the few Trump-appointed prosecutors to be retained in the Biden administration.Mr. Garland did not dismiss Mr. Weiss, a Republican, to ensure the appearance of impartiality — a strategy aimed at protecting the department, and to some degree himself, from accusations of political favoritism.But although Mr. Garland entered office vowing to restore confidence in the Justice Department’s independence, he has confronted an unrelenting succession of politically sensitive investigations, and his attempt to project impartiality is often drowned out in the intensely polarized environment he operates in.“For Garland, there’s a kind of jujitsu in all of this — it may be principled commitment, cynical optics or a combination of both — but it’s geared at survival in a tough environment,” said Jed Handelsman Shugerman, a professor at Fordham Law School who has studied the department’s history and its leadership. “Merrick Garland’s constituencies are political — they are ghosts of justice past, justice future and the rule of law.”Yet if Mr. Garland had any illusions that that approach would shield him from criticism (and aides say he does not), they have been emphatically dispelled.Even after Mr. Weiss conducted a five-year investigation that yielded evidence to charge Mr. Biden only on narrow charges, Republicans, including those who take a dim view of Mr. Trump’s handling of classified material after he left office, have accused the White House and Mr. Garland of weaponizing the Justice Department.Under the agreement, Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and avoid prosecution on a separate gun charge. If a federal judge signs off on the deal, Mr. Biden will be placed in a two-year diversion program for nonviolent offenders convicted of gun crimes and will face no jail time.The announcement of the deal came shortly after Mr. Trump was accused of putting national security secrets at risk and obstructing efforts by the government to reclaim classified records.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decried the deal as evidence of a “two-tiered” system of justice under Mr. Garland that has resulted in the aggressive prosecution of Mr. Trump, and leniency toward the president’s allies and family — although the two cases differ substantially.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. But Mr. Garland is likely to be pressed about the agreement on Wednesday, when he holds a news conference before heading back to the United States.In the past, Mr. Garland has brushed aside questions and referred the matter to Mr. Weiss.“I have pledged not to interfere with that investigation, and I have carried through on my pledge,” Mr. Garland said during an appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, responding to sharp questioning from Republicans about the Hunter Biden investigation.People close to the situation said that Mr. Garland did not weigh in on the Hunter Biden deal, but said he was informed of the agreement.Not surprisingly, many of Mr. Trump’s closest allies greeted that with suspicion.Tom Fitton, who founded Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group in Washington, called the plea deal and diversion agreement “a miscarriage of justice whose chief beneficiary is President Biden.” He questioned why Mr. Garland had not appointed a special counsel who might have produced a public report explaining why prosecutors did not seek a harsher penalty, as did John Durham, the special counsel who investigated the origins of the inquiry into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.“Garland, not Weiss, is the one who is ultimately responsible, and there’s no deal that would proceed without Garland’s agreement or complicity,” Mr. Fitton said in an interview. “He ignored the regulations, which required the appointment of a special counsel, conveniently.”Mr. Garland never seriously considered appointing a special counsel, in part because they were not deemed necessary in prior investigations of presidential family members, according to a former law enforcement official familiar with the case.Democrats, for their part, rallied to his defense.“This development reflects the Justice Department’s continued institutional independence in following the evidence of actual crimes and enforcing the rule of law” in the face of Republican “heckling” Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said in a statement.;Garland’s aides say his trip to Europe had been weeks in the making, and his absence from the country was happenstance, not calculation.“He ignored the regulations, which required the appointment of a special counsel, conveniently.”Mr.;2023-06-21T00:19:12+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:27.455499+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60451;Republicans Claim Double Standard in Hunter Biden Charges;Congressional Republicans accused President Biden of orchestrating a lenient penalty for his son, while Democrats argued that bringing any charges reflected the Justice Department’s independence.;Congressional Republicans on Tuesday blasted the plea deal Hunter Biden reached with the Justice Department, accusing President Biden of orchestrating a lenient penalty for his son and promising to intensify their investigations of the Biden family.Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the agreement, in which Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay taxes on time and could avoid prosecution on a separate gun charge, “continues to show the two-tier system in America.”He and many other Republicans drew a contrast between the charges against Mr. Biden and the 37-count indictment the Justice Department unsealed this month against former President Donald J. Trump on charges that he mishandled highly classified national security documents and lied to and obstructed investigators looking into the matter.“If you are the president’s leading political opponent, D.O.J. tries to literally put in you jail and give you prison time,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol. “If you are the president’s son, you get a sweetheart deal.”Mr. Trump is accused of willfully retaining national defense secrets in violation of the Espionage Act, making false statements and engaging in a conspiracy to obstruct justice — far more serious crimes than the ones for which the younger Mr. Biden was scrutinized.Leading Democrats argued that bringing any charges at all against the president’s son reflected the independence of the Justice Department, noting that the United States attorney who led the investigation into Hunter Biden, David C. Weiss, was appointed by Mr. Trump.“This development reflects the Justice Department’s continued institutional independence in following the evidence of actual crimes and enforcing the rule of law even in the face of constant criticism and heckling by my G.O.P. colleagues who think that the system of justice should only follow their partisan wishes,” Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.Still, Mr. McCarthy said the deal should only “enhance” congressional Republicans’ investigation into the Bidens.Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the chairman of the Oversight Committee undertaking that inquiry, said he would do just that in a statement calling the charges against Hunter Biden a “slap on the wrist.”“We will not rest until the full extent of President Biden’s involvement in the family’s schemes are revealed,” said Mr. Comer, who has been looking for evidence of wrongdoing by the president in his inquiry, but has so far failed to unearth any.Senator Rick Scott of Florida also pushed the idea that the plea deal reflected a politicized Justice Department going easy on Mr. Biden while pursuing Mr. Trump.“A slap on the wrist for Hunter Biden while ‘The Big Guy’ continues to hunt down his top political opponent,” he wrote on Twitter. “This doesn’t show equal justice. It’s a mockery of our legal system by a family that has no respect for our laws.”And Senator J.D. Vance, the Ohio Republican who announced after Mr. Trump’s indictment that he would block consideration of Biden administration nominees to positions at the Justice Department, said Hunter Biden’s case reinforced his argument.“This is exhibit 1,402 for why I’m holding Biden’s DOJ nominees,” he wrote on Twitter. “We have a two-tiered justice system in our country. It’s a disgrace.”;tries to literally put in you jail and give you prison time,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol.“If you are the president’s son, you get a sweetheart deal.”Mr.“We have a two-tiered justice system in our country.;2023-06-20T18:26:15+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:27.938625+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60452;How Trump Has Tried to Use Hunter Biden to Attack the President;Donald Trump has for years depicted Hunter Biden as corrupt and used unsubstantiated claims to link his Democratic rival to his son’s business dealings.;Former President Donald J. Trump has been among the most insistent of Republican voices seeking to use Hunter Biden as a way to discredit his father, President Biden — and the guilty plea on Tuesday quickly became yet another point of attack as Mr. Trump seeks the Republican presidential nomination for a third time.But for Mr. Trump and his allies, decrying Hunter Biden has long served as a political applause line — most notably during the 2020 race.It was in the run-up to that campaign that Mr. Trump was first impeached, in 2019, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — charges that stemmed from a phone call Mr. Trump made to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, during which he pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate leading Democrats and to open an inquiry into Hunter Biden.Mr. Trump repeatedly circulated unsubstantiated claims in efforts to link his Democratic rival to his son’s business dealings, which he painted as corrupt, even before Mr. Biden became his party’s nominee.In 2019, Mr. Trump publicly called for China to examine Hunter Biden’s financial dealings in the country. Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that Hunter Biden “made millions of dollars from China” and that he used his political connections to persuade China to invest $1.5 billion in a fund he was involved in.At campaign rallies, Mr. Trump frequently levied claims that Hunter Biden was corrupt, often pointing to a New York Post report about a laptop that was seized by the F.B.I.And during a presidential debate in October 2020, Mr. Trump repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that Mr. Biden had both served as a consultant and used his former position as vice president to help secure business deals for his son. That series of attacks drew further public scrutiny to Mr. Biden’s son’s activities, as searches for “Hunter Biden” skyrocketed following the exchanges during the debate.Mr. Trump later called for his attorney general, William P. Barr, to take action against his Democratic challenger for his son’s work, just two weeks before the 2020 election.Now, with Mr. Trump newly arraigned on federal charges over his handling of classified documents, he and many Republicans have sought to cast Hunter Biden’s agreement with federal prosecutors as overly lenient and sought to establish a double-standard narrative.Mr. Trump likened Hunter Biden’s charges to that of a “traffic ticket,” in a post on his Truth Social website shortly after the guilty plea was announced on Tuesday.;That series of attacks drew further public scrutiny to Mr. Biden’s son’s activities, as searches for “Hunter Biden” skyrocketed following the exchanges during the debate.Mr.Trump likened Hunter Biden’s charges to that of a “traffic ticket,” in a post on his Truth Social website shortly after the guilty plea was announced on Tuesday.;2023-06-20T21:08:56+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:28.547493+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60453;What Happens if a Presidential Candidate Is Convicted?;The Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that would arise. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory.;Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.Former President Donald J. Trump faces no campaign restrictions. Though he has been charged with dozens of felonies across two cases, one federal and one in New York, verdicts are a long way off. And there are many uncertainties, including whether the proceedings will hinder Mr. Trump’s campaign in practical ways or begin to hurt him in the polls in a way they have not so far.But if he is convicted on any of the felony counts, things get more complicated — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that would arise.Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.Here is what we know, and what we don’t know.This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be “natural born” citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. (While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.)To offer an obvious understatement, it would be logistically difficult to run for president from prison. No major-party candidate has ever done it. Mr. Debs ran for the Socialist Party in 1920 and received about 3 percent of the vote.But Mr. Trump’s campaign staff could handle fund-raising and other campaign activities in his absence, and it is very unlikely that Mr. Trump could be disqualified from appearing on ballots.The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.“We let states set the time, place and manner” of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, “but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don’t let the state add new substantive requirements.”While that view is not universal among legal experts, it won in court in 2019, when California tried to require candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the rule, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.Probably not.Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he will be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.No one knows.“We’re so far removed from anything that’s ever happened,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. “It’s just guessing.”Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. “I don’t think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,” Professor Levinson said.In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump’s lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.He could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a “self pardon” was constitutional.Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that “the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,” Professor Chemerinsky said.Again, no one knows. But a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges and end the case.The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.“The reasons why we wouldn’t want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn’t want to prosecute a sitting president,” said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department’s reasoning. “My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We’re following the 1973 memo.’”Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.Charlie Savage contributed reporting.;And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.Former President Donald J. Trump faces no campaign restrictions.)To offer an obvious understatement, it would be logistically difficult to run for president from prison.“It’s just guessing.”Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned.;2023-06-20T17:52:12+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:29.017008+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60454;Elton John Warns of ‘Growing Swell of Anger and Homophobia’ in U.S.;“We seem to be going backwards,” the pop superstar warned as he lamented the curtailing of L.G.B.T.Q. rights in the United States, particularly in Florida.;The British pop superstar Elton John lamented the “growing swell of anger and homophobia” in the United States and described several laws recently passed in Florida that curtail L.G.B.T.Q. rights as “disgraceful.”“It’s all going pear-shaped in America,” John, a longtime leader for gay rights and visibility, said in an interview published Tuesday in Radio Times, in which he pointed to a rise in violent incidents and recent legislation curtailing rights. “We seem to be going backwards. And that spreads. It’s like a virus that the L.G.B.T.Q.+ movement is suffering.”More than 520 pieces of such legislation have been introduced in over 40 states this year, a record, according to the Human Rights Campaign, an L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group.“I don’t like it at all,” John said, referring to the increasingly hostile climate. “It’s a growing swell of anger and homophobia that’s around America.”John, 76, will headline Glastonbury, Britain’s biggest music festival, on Sunday, as his lengthy final tour, Farewell Yellow Brick Road, heads toward its finale in Stockholm on July 8. The tour, which will have had over 330 dates, began in 2018 but was interrupted by the pandemic as well as John’s hip surgery.As he prepared to perform at Glastonbury, the last British date on the tour, John said that he did not know if the rising anti-L.G.B.T.Q. sentiment is as prevalent in Britain. “I don’t know if it’s around Britain, because I haven’t been here that much,” he said.But he called the scandal around the prominent British news anchor Phillip Schofield — who recently resigned after admitting he had a relationship with a younger man — “totally homophobic.”“If it was a straight guy in a fling with a young woman, it wouldn’t even make the papers,” John said.In the interview with Radio Times, John said he might eventually be open to doing a residency after his farewell tour ends, “but not in America.” That, his representatives said, is for the same reason that he had decided to stop touring: He wants to spend more time with his husband and children, who live in Britain.Last year, John — who objected to his songs being played at rallies for former President Donald J. Trump — performed at the Biden White House. “I just wish America could be more bipartisan,” John said as he sat at his piano.

60455;Judge in Trump Documents Case Sets Tentative Trial Date as Soon as August;The judge, Aileen M. Cannon, set an aggressive schedule for moving the case forward, though the proceedings are likely to be delayed by pretrial clashes.;The federal judge presiding over the prosecution of former President Donald J. Trump in the classified documents case set an aggressive schedule on Tuesday, ordering a trial to begin as soon as Aug. 14.The timeline set by the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, is likely to be delayed by extensive pretrial litigation — including over how to handle classified material — and its brisk pace seems in keeping with a schedule set under the Speedy Trial Act. In each of four other criminal trials the judge has overseen that were identified in a New York Times review, she has initially set a relatively quick trial date and later pushed it back.The early moves by Judge Cannon, a relatively inexperienced jurist who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, are being particularly closely watched. She disrupted the documents investigation last year with several rulings favorable to the former president before a conservative appeals court overturned her, saying that she never had legitimate legal authority to intervene.Brandon L. Van Grack, a former federal prosecutor who has worked on complex criminal matters involving national security, said the trial date was “unlikely to hold” considering that the process of turning over classified evidence to the defense in discovery had not yet begun. Still, he said, Judge Cannon appeared to be showing that she intended to do what she could to push the case to trial quickly.“It signals that the court is at least trying to do everything it can to move the case along and that it’s important that the case proceed quickly,” Mr. Van Grack said. “Even though it’s unlikely to hold, it’s at least a positive signal — positive in the sense that all parties and the public should want this case to proceed as quickly as possible.”But it is not clear that the defense wants the case to proceed quickly. Mr. Trump’s strategy in legal matters has long been to delay them, and the federal case against him is unlikely to be an exception. If a trial drags past the 2024 election and Mr. Trump wins the race, he could, in theory, try to pardon himself — or he could direct his attorney general to drop the charges and wipe out the case.In public remarks after the indictment against Mr. Trump and one of his aides, Walt Nauta, was filed two weeks ago in Federal District Court in Miami, the special counsel, Jack Smith, who oversaw the investigation, said he wanted a speedy trial.The schedule that Judge Cannon set forth in her order on Tuesday clearly does that, requesting that all pretrial motions be filed by July 24.She also ruled that the trial — and all the hearings in the case — will be held at her home courthouse in Fort Pierce, Fla., a small town in the northern portion of the Southern District of Florida. Mr. Trump’s arraignment was held in the federal courthouse in Miami.Pretrial proceedings in the case are highly unlikely to be done by August. Legal experts have identified a series of complicated matters that Judge Cannon, the defense and the prosecution will have to work through before the matter is ready to go in front of a jury.For one thing, following Judge Cannon’s orders, Mr. Trump’s lawyers started the process of obtaining the security clearances needed to deal with the significant classified evidence issues in the case only last week. The background check process to obtain the clearances can take months.Mr. Trump’s legal team is also still in flux. Mr. Nauta’s lawyer, Stanley Woodward Jr., is still interviewing Florida-based lawyers to assist him with the case. He expects to have someone in place when Mr. Nauta is arraigned next week.Beyond the array of legal tactics that Mr. Trump’s lawyers may use to attack the validity of the charges against him, the parties in the case will also have to engage in significant closed-door litigation over how to handle the classified evidence at the heart of the government’s prosecution. Mr. Trump has been accused of illegally holding on to 31 individual national defense documents, many of which were marked as top secret.Much of the secret litigation will take place under the aegis of the Classified Information Procedures Act. If the government does not agree with any of Judge Cannon’s rulings involving the act, it can pause pretrial proceedings and appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta. (The defense would have to wait until after any conviction to appeal an evidentiary issue under the act.)Mr. Trump’s lawyers are expected to file a battery of pretrial motions, including one claiming that he is being selectively prosecuted while other public officials investigated for mishandling classified material — chief among them, Hillary Clinton — did not face charges.The former president’s legal team may also file motions accusing prosecutors of various types of misconduct or seeking to suppress audio notes by one of his lawyers, which the government obtained before the indictment and was filed by piercing the traditional protections of attorney-client privilege.Depending on how seriously Judge Cannon considers the claims made in those filings, she could order additional briefs, attestations and hearings, further slowing down the process.The preliminary court calendar underscores how Mr. Trump’s decision to press ahead with his political campaign, now a key part of his defense, could affect the broader presidential primary race. The first Republican debate is scheduled for Aug. 23 in Milwaukee. Mr. Trump has not said whether he is attending and has signaled he might skip the first two debates.The second debate is scheduled for September, and there is expected to be one each month through the end of the year. Depending on the court calendar, Mr. Trump’s political plans could again coincide with court dates.What’s more, this is not Mr. Trump’s only court proceeding. His trial in a Manhattan state court, on charges stemming from hush money payments to a porn actress during the 2016 presidential campaign, is set to begin in March. A second defamation trial, brought by a New York writer who claimed Mr. Trump raped her decades ago, is set to begin in January.The former president is also facing the prospect of at least one more indictment. Prosecutors in Fulton County, Ga., may bring charges in connection with his efforts to stay in office. Mr. Smith, the special counsel, is also still investigating issues related to Mr. Trump’s efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election.;Mr. Trump’s strategy in legal matters has long been to delay them, and the federal case against him is unlikely to be an exception.Mr. Trump’s arraignment was held in the federal courthouse in Miami.Pretrial proceedings in the case are highly unlikely to be done by August.Depending on the court calendar, Mr. Trump’s political plans could again coincide with court dates.What’s more, this is not Mr. Trump’s only court proceeding.;2023-06-20T16:37:31+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:30.095974+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60456;Hunter Biden Reaches Deal to Plead Guilty to Misdemeanor Tax Charges;Under an agreement with the Justice Department, the president’s son agreed to probation for filing his taxes late, and he can avoid a charge that he lied about his drug use when he bought a gun.;Hunter Biden agreed with the Justice Department on Tuesday to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and accept terms that would allow him to avoid prosecution on a separate gun charge, a big step toward ending a long-running and politically explosive investigation into the finances, drug use and international business dealings of President Biden’s troubled son.Under a deal hashed out with a federal prosecutor who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his 2017 and 2018 taxes on time and be sentenced to probation.The Justice Department also charged Mr. Biden but, under what is known as a pretrial diversion agreement, said it would not prosecute him in connection with his purchase of a handgun in 2018 during a period when he was using drugs. The deal is contingent on Mr. Biden remaining drug-free for 24 months and agreeing never to own a firearm again.The agreement must still be approved by a federal judge. Mr. Biden is expected to appear in court in Delaware in the coming days to be arraigned on the misdemeanor tax charges and plead guilty.“With the announcement of two agreements between my client, Hunter Biden, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware, it is my understanding that the five-year investigation into Hunter is resolved,” Mr. Biden’s lawyer, Christopher Clark, said in a statement.Assuming there are no last-minute changes or complications, the deal would most likely resolve the investigation without Mr. Biden facing a federal prison sentence.Even though years of investigation by a Republican-appointed prosecutor found evidence to charge Mr. Biden only on the narrow tax and gun issues rather than the broader international conspiracies promoted by Mr. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, the agreement was assailed by the right as too lenient.The agreement came less than two weeks after the Justice Department indicted Mr. Trump on charges that he risked exposing national security secrets and obstructed efforts by the government to reclaim classified documents from him. On Tuesday, Republicans argued that the deal demonstrated a partisan double standard, despite the clear differences in the nature and scope of the cases.“The corrupt Biden DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere ‘traffic ticket,’” Mr. Trump proclaimed on his website, Truth Social.The federal prosecutor who oversaw the inquiry and signed off on the agreement, David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, set out the terms in a terse public statement that concluded, without elaboration, “The investigation is ongoing.”A White House spokesman, Ian Sams, said in a statement: “The president and first lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment.”The crimes to which Mr. Biden is pleading guilty, said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and a sentencing expert, are ones that the average person is rarely prosecuted for because they are usually only brought along with more serious offenses.“If these are the only offenses, most prosecutors are going to say it’s not worth a federal case,” Mr. Berman said. “They would say: Let’s not make a federal case of it for the average person because it’s not worth it to bring a case unless there’s reason to be concerned that there’s a public safety issue or the trust that everyone is treated equally under the law is at stake.”Mr. Berman said that in this case, federal prosecutors were in a unique situation because the very high-profile defendant was the subject of investigations for a variety of activities. The failure to bring some charges when there is no factual dispute, he said, could create the impression of a two-tiered system of justice.“Everyone is paying attention, and the facts are not in dispute, so a failure to bring charges would create the perception that there was some sort of special treatment or leniency being given to the president’s son,” Mr. Berman said.No one questions that Mr. Biden, a 53-year-old Yale-educated lawyer, has had significant personal troubles and pursued a professional path that has intersected with his father’s in ways that have raised ethical issues.After his father became vice president in 2009, he built relationships with wealthy foreigners that brought in millions of dollars, surfacing concerns inside the Obama administration and among government watchdog groups that he was cashing in on his family name.He went into a downward spiral after his brother, Beau, died in 2015, becoming addicted to crack cocaine and engaging in tawdry, self-destructive behavior.As president, Mr. Trump had long sought to tie Hunter Biden’s business deals and personal troubles to his father. Mr. Trump’s first impeachment had its roots in his efforts to persuade the Ukrainian government to help him show wrongdoing in Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, and while in the White House he pressured the Justice Department to investigate.The Justice Department investigation continued after President Biden took office, under the oversight of Mr. Weiss, the Trump appointee, who was kept on and allowed to finish the inquiry. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland has testified to Congress that Mr. Weiss had full authority and independence to decide whether to bring a case against Mr. Biden.In a letter last month to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Weiss said that he had been “granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges.”While the outcome of the investigation appeared fairly straightforward in the five pages of documents made public on Tuesday, it was the result of a lengthy back-and-forth between Mr. Biden’s lawyers and the Justice Department. The exchange was more akin to the interactions between the government and a major corporation facing a complex investigation.The discussions started several years ago when Mr. Biden’s lawyers responded to grand jury subpoenas as prosecutors were examining an array of matters, including his dealings with Chinese investors and his work for Burisma, whose board he served on while his father, as vice president, was overseeing the Obama administration’s policy toward Ukraine.After it was clear that the investigation had narrowed to just the tax and gun issues, slow-moving negotiations ensued. Legal experts said that the use of the diversion agreement to resolve the gun charge was creative, fairly unusual and likely the product of Mr. Weiss wanting to show that the government was refusing to look the other way on behavior that was likely criminal but is rarely prosecuted.“Hunter will take responsibility for two instances of misdemeanor failure to file tax payments when due pursuant to a plea agreement,” Mr. Clark said in his statement. “A firearm charge, which will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be the subject of the plea agreement, will also be filed by the government.”Mr. Clark continued: “I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.”The investigation focused on a particularly chaotic and unseemly period in Hunter Biden’s life when he was addicted to crack cocaine. But the Justice Department went through nearly every major aspect of his life over the past 15 years — a period in which he also struggled to control his alcoholism and engaged in international business deals, which he got into at least in part because of his father’s prominence in politics.But in the end, the investigation came down to two issues.One was his taxes. Prosecutors had been considering whether to indict him in connection with his failure to meet filing deadlines for his 2017 and 2018 taxes, and whether he had improperly claimed $30,000 in deductions for business expenses.In his statement on Tuesday, Mr. Weiss said Mr. Biden had earned more than $1.5 million in each of 2017 and 2018 but failed to file income tax returns despite owing the government more than $100,000 each year. (Mr. Biden paid the overdue tax bill in 2021.)The second issue was whether Mr. Biden lied on a United States government form that he filled out when he purchased the handgun in 2018. In response to a question on the form about whether he was using drugs, Mr. Biden had said he was not — an assertion that prosecutors suspected might be false based on his erratic behavior at the time and accounts from people who interacted with him.Under the agreement announced on Tuesday, Mr. Biden will acknowledge that he “possessed a firearm despite knowing he was an unlawful user of and addicted to a controlled substance,” Mr. Weiss’s statement said.Not long after the purchase of the gun, Beau’s widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter had a romantic relationship at the time, found the weapon in his truck. Fearing he might use the gun to take his own life, Ms. Biden tossed it in a dumpster.Republicans’ allegations that the elder President Biden’s Justice Department went easy on his son are unlikely to fade away.In April, an I.R.S. supervisor who had been overseeing the investigation into Hunter Biden hired a lawyer and went to Congress, alleging political favoritism in how the investigation had been handled. Congressional Republicans have pledged to investigate the claims, which have also been referred to inspectors general at the Justice Department and I.R.S.Reporting was contributed by Seamus Hughes, Reid J. Epstein, Luke Broadwater, Glenn Thrush, Kayla Guo and Jonathan Weisman.;The deal is contingent on Mr. Biden remaining drug-free for 24 months and agreeing never to own a firearm again.The agreement must still be approved by a federal judge.“A firearm charge, which will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be the subject of the plea agreement, will also be filed by the government.”Mr.supervisor who had been overseeing the investigation into Hunter Biden hired a lawyer and went to Congress, alleging political favoritism in how the investigation had been handled.;2023-06-21T02:52:01+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:30.589161+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60457;What Republicans Say About Their Risky Balancing Act on Abortion;The historic Dobbs ruling has hurt the party electorally, but G.O.P. lawmakers are still moving to pass more restrictive laws. These two realities represent the defining political fallout of the end of Roe v. Wade.;"In the year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, one of the country’s most emotionally charged issues has come to be defined by two seemingly contradictory political realities.In competitive general elections, abortion rights emerged as among the greatest electoral strengths for Democrats and, often, a clear liability for Republicans: Americans say at record levels that they support at least some access to the procedure, and the issue has fueled Democratic victories across the nation.At the same time, Republican-dominated state legislatures have moved rapidly to sharply limit or ban access to abortion. Activists are demanding that G.O.P. presidential candidates make firm commitments about federal restrictions, and are urging ever-further-reaching legislation in the states.This headlong rush into risky territory for the national Republican Party — and the extraordinary backlash against some of those measures — represents the enduring political fallout of the Supreme Court decision, which transformed a partisan standoff 50 years in the making.Anti-abortion activists and some Republican strategists applaud the approach of many state legislatures, arguing that voters expect their lawmakers to deliver on upholding one of the core tenets of the conservative movement.“If you can, you must,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the major anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. “To fail to do that would, politically, would be a disaster for pro-life voters who put them in office.”But as the anniversary of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe arrives on Saturday, interviews with more than a dozen Republican lawmakers, strategists and anti-abortion activists paint a portrait of a party still struggling to find a consensus on abortion policy, and grappling with how to energize core base voters on the issue without alienating swing voters.Many observers see the wave of new restrictions, which vary in gestational limit and exceptions and have sometimes been held up in court, as a function of several factors: years of promises and pent-up energy on the right; deeply held convictions about when life begins; and gerrymandering that has often left Republican lawmakers more worried about far-right primary challenges than about turning off moderate voters in general elections.But for a critical slice of Republicans — those who represent competitive districts in state legislatures or in Congress, who support some degree of abortion rights, or, in some cases, presidential candidates — the issue presents a particularly difficult balancing act.Their decisions and calculations are at the heart of the tensions over the abortion debate within the Republican Party in the post-Roe era.“I was hearing from both sides strongly,” said State Representative Mike Caruso of Florida, a Republican who opposed a measure — ultimately signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis — that forbids abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, with a few exceptions. “It was pretty much a ban on abortion.”“I’ve got seven children, been through nine pregnancies,” he added. “I don’t think I ever knew, we ever knew, that we were pregnant prior to six weeks.”But, demonstrating the vastly different views on the issue within the party, State Representative Mike Beltran of Florida said that while he voted for the measure, “frankly, I don’t think it goes far enough.”“All these bills were huge compromises,” said Mr. Beltran, who said he personally opposed abortion rights without exception, suggesting that if a mother’s life was in danger, barring ectopic pregnancies, the answer could often be to deliver the fetus, even months prematurely. “We should suffer electoral consequences if we don’t do what we said we would do.”Anti-abortion activists and lawmakers have vigorously made a version of that argument to Republican candidates, sometimes citing polling to show lawmakers what they believe voters in a particular state will accept. (Some of these surveys are commissioned by abortion opponents, and their findings can be at odds with public polling.)“It’s a fundamental issue to Republicans to protect life,” said Tami Fitzgerald, the executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition. She supported the state’s new ban on most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, though she wants restrictions that go much further, calling a six-week ban “step two.”“A candidate needs the pro-life voters in order to win,” she added.In an interview this month, Ms. Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony urged candidates to be “very clear on what it means to be ambitious for life” while seeking to draw contrasts with Democrats on the issue, warning of the risks of being defined by the other side.This is not a “theoretical messaging moment,” she said. “This is real life.”In the presidential contest, though, some of the candidates have tried to skirt questions about what national restrictions they would support. Contenders including former President Donald J. Trump — who helped muscle through Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe possible — have indicated that they think the issue should be resolved by the states, though Mr. Trump has also been vague on the issue.“Their hesitancy to communicate has been frustrating,” Ms. Dannenfelser said, referring broadly to the field. But the debate stage, she said, is “going to be where the rubber meets the road, and our bright-red line saying that you must have a 15-week or better limit or we can’t support you.”Yet when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina last year proposed a federal ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with some exceptions, he ignited immediate resistance from numerous fellow Republicans, evidence that some in the party see political peril in a national ban.And polling has shown that most Americans support at least some abortion rights, especially early in pregnancy.A Gallup survey released last week found that a record-high 69 percent of Americans, including 47 percent of Republicans, believed that abortion should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy.“That just makes me wonder if maybe there is some room for nuance there within the party,” said Lydia Saad, the director of U.S. social research at Gallup. “But nuance isn’t generally very successful in politics.”In some states, Republican lawmakers have cast bans with some exceptions that begin after 12 weeks, toward the end of the first trimester, as something of a middle ground. And from Nebraska to South Carolina, there have indeed been lawmakers who said they could not back a six-week ban but indicated that they were more comfortable with 12 weeks, even as such proposals have drawn condemnation from some in local business and medical communities.In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, vetoed the 12-week ban. He and other abortion rights supporters warned that the measure would interfere with critical medical decisions and create dangerous barriers for women seeking abortions.But Republicans, who recently gained narrow veto-proof majorities in North Carolina, quickly sought to override Mr. Cooper’s move. The effort forced some of their members into contortions.State Representative Ted Davis Jr., a Republican, indicated during his campaign last year that he backed the state’s law allowing abortions up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. When the state legislature took up the 12-week measure, he skipped the vote.But citing factors including loyalty to his caucus, frustration with the other side and constituents who, he said, seemed split on the veto override, he ultimately joined fellow Republicans to override the veto, helping to ensure that the more restrictive measure prevailed.Still, he tried to draw a distinction between the two votes.“What concerns me is what’s going to happen in the future as far as access to abortion,” he said. “Are Republicans now going to try to restrict it even further?”Other lawmakers have sought to punish women who seek abortions, or those who help them. Some Republican lawmakers in South Carolina moved — unsuccessfully — to treat abortion at any stage of pregnancy as homicide, which can carry the death penalty.That measure would have given “more rights to a rapist than a woman who’s been raped,” said Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who flipped a seat from a Democrat in 2020. “That’s where the conversation has gone.”“They listen to some of the extreme voices, and they operate and vote and legislate out of fear,” she said. “They’re not hearing from the rest of the electorate, the 95 percent of the folks who vote in elections. They’re hearing from the 5 percent who say, ‘You’re not Republican if you don’t want to ban abortions with no exceptions.’”Even in her conservative state, there were pockets of Republican resistance to efforts to pass a near-total abortion ban. A six-week ban passed the legislature but is now tied up in court.“I probably will draw a primary challenger,” conceded State Senator Katrina Shealy, who opposed that measure, with its many requirements for women seeking abortions. She has already been censured by a local Republican county party.Some on the far right, she suggested, “don’t want people to wear masks. They don’t want people to get vaccines.”They believe, she said, that “they should have full rights — but don’t let women make this decision. And that’s not right.”";)“It’s a fundamental issue to Republicans to protect life,” said Tami Fitzgerald, the executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition.“Are Republicans now going to try to restrict it even further?”Other lawmakers have sought to punish women who seek abortions, or those who help them.They don’t want people to get vaccines.”They believe, she said, that “they should have full rights — but don’t let women make this decision.;2023-06-20T14:38:04+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:31.138155+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60458;Blinken Visit Reveals Chasm in How U.S. and China Perceive Rivalry;Xi Jinping and nationalistic Chinese see recent U.S. actions as an effort to contain another superpower rather than compete with it — and they’re pushing back.;An austere greeting on the airport tarmac in Beijing sans a red carpet. A stone-faced handshake from China’s top foreign policy official. A seat looking up at the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, perched at the head of a long table.To international audiences, the optics of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s two-day visit to Beijing barely raised any eyebrows. Foreign ministers are rarely, if ever, met with much fanfare at the airport. And an audience with a head of state alone is a sign of great importance and respect.But to nationalist-leaning audiences in China, especially on social media, the scenes tell a different story. To them, Mr. Blinken arrived only after months of pleading for an invitation. And during his visit, he was schooled on respecting China’s interests and played supplicant to Mr. Xi. Chinese social media users gleefully noted that Mr. Blinken arrived on Father’s Day, the implication being — using the parlance of the internet — that Mr. Xi was America’s daddy.The nationalistic commentary in China around Mr. Blinken’s visit underscored a point that Mr. Xi made in his meeting with the top American diplomat on Monday: “Major-country competition does not represent the trend of the times.” The translation: Surrounding China with security partners and cutting off its access to advanced technology is not healthy competition, but an invitation for conflict.Mr. Xi’s rejection of the framing of U.S.-China relations by the two most recent American presidents raises doubts about whether the world’s two superpowers can reach a strategic accommodation with each other in the coming years.“They apparently don’t buy into this framework at all,” said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.“That begs the question: Is it then possible to stabilize relations?”It is unclear to what extent the state played a role in promoting the triumphant narrative online, though Chinese censors generally have broad controls to sway public opinion. In China’s state-controlled news outlets, which mostly carried the government’s summaries of the meetings, coverage of the visit emphasized Beijing’s view that Mr. Blinken was visiting to reassure the Chinese government and listen to its concerns.Casting China as a strong and responsible power willing to lower tensions with a belligerent United States may help mask the less politically palatable reasons Beijing wants to re-engage with Washington, analysts say. Chief among them is the need to stabilize the Chinese economy, which has been struggling to maintain a recovery after coming out of three years of punishing pandemic restrictions.“The optics of Xi Jinping lecturing to a subordinate American secretary of state from the head of a boardroom table plays well to a domestic audience that China is a global power that not only demands, but receives, respect from other great powers,” said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.He noted that Mr. Blinken’s two immediate predecessors — Mike Pompeo and Rex W. Tillerson — were seated next to Mr. Xi in armchairs when they met. (Mr. Xi sat with Mr. Pompeo in Beijing in June 2018, but did not meet the U.S. secretary when he returned that October.) Others pointed out that Bill Gates was invited to sit down next to a smiling Mr. Xi in an ornate wooden chair last week.American officials say Mr. Blinken’s trip was necessary because maintaining regular high-level diplomacy between the world’s two superpower rivals — and its two largest economies and militaries — is critical to avoiding open conflict. Not only do the two governments seek stability in the relationship, but so do their allies and other nations. And diplomacy allows the two sides to make their views clear in private and public talks.“If you want to stand up for American values on human rights and if you want to free detained Americans here or enlist China’s help on the fentanyl crisis, you can’t do it from the sidelines,” R. Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, said in an interview on Tuesday. “You need to talk to them and press them as Secretary Blinken did on his visit here. You don’t give anything away by talking.”“The Chinese received the secretary with a great deal of dignity,” added Mr. Burns, who was in all of Mr. Blinken’s meetings. “President Xi Jinping was very courteous in the meeting.”Chinese officials, keen to turn the focus to commerce as an anchor in U.S.-China relations, had pushed for Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, and Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, to visit first, but American officials insisted that Mr. Blinken had to precede them. Now those other two U.S. cabinet officials are expected to travel to Beijing this summer, as is John Kerry, the climate envoy.Analysts say China hopes the talks can help bolster business confidence when many of the traditional levers of Chinese economic growth, such as real estate, are facing dramatic challenges.Moreover, China wants to underscore to the Biden administration its opposition to trade restrictions that choke Chinese access to important technologies, such as advanced semiconductor chips.“Xi’s main motivation in entertaining the Americans is because the Chinese economy is in a really bad state,” said Willy Lam, an analyst of Chinese politics who is a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a research institute in Washington. “Exports are down noticeably, and more U.S. and Western firms are moving production bases away from China.”In hosting Mr. Blinken, China also sought to lay the groundwork for Mr. Xi to visit the United States in November for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit — a trip that could lead to a one-on-one meeting with President Biden, the kind of visit that would help burnish Mr. Xi’s image as a global statesman.Beijing may also be moved by a sense of urgency to press the Biden administration for more assurances that it won’t inflame pro-independence sentiment in Taiwan, especially ahead of presidential elections in both the United States and Taiwan next year. In both places, politicians have ramped up rhetoric critical of the Chinese Communist Party during campaign years because they think that helps win votes.China has been furious over the Biden administration’s growing support for the democratic, self-governed island — including a new trade agreement, more weapons sales and increased exchanges between officials. The Blinken visit gave China an opportunity to signal that it has warned the United States not to provoke Beijing over what its leaders have called the “core of China’s core interests.”While Mr. Blinken’s visit may have helped end the freeze in top-level bilateral diplomacy, it also highlighted the fact that important dialogue between the two nations remains imperiled by China’s attitude over Taiwan and the widening military and economic rivalry.After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last August, Beijing froze formal interactions with Washington on military issues, climate change and narcotics. China has only agreed to restore talks on climate change. U.S. officials went into the meetings in Beijing hoping to get China to reopen direct channels of military-to-military communications, including ones between the U.S. defense secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Indo-Pacific Command and their Chinese counterparts.Chinese officials meeting with Mr. Blinken rejected the request.Olivia Wang contributed reporting.;And during his visit, he was schooled on respecting China’s interests and played supplicant to Mr. Xi.(Mr. Xi sat with Mr. Pompeo in Beijing in June 2018, but did not meet the U.S. secretary when he returned that October.)You don’t give anything away by talking.”“The Chinese received the secretary with a great deal of dignity,” added Mr. Burns, who was in all of Mr. Blinken’s meetings.;2023-06-21T06:37:34+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:31.698125+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60459;Federal Policy on Homelessness Becomes New Target of the Right;The approach known as Housing First has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But conservatives are pushing efforts to replace it with programs that put more emphasis on sobriety and employment.;The bipartisan approach that has dominated federal homelessness policy for more than two decades is under growing conservative attack.The policy directs billions of dollars to programs that provide homeless people with permanent housing and offer — but do not require them to accept — services like treatment for mental illness or drug abuse. The approach, called Housing First, has been the subject of extensive study and expanded under presidents as different as George W. Bush and Barack Obama. President Biden’s homelessness plan makes Housing First its cornerstone and cites it a dozen times.But Housing First has become a conservative epithet.Republican lawmakers, backed by conservative think tanks and programs denied funding by Housing First rules, want to loosen the policy’s grip on federal dollars. While supporters say that housing people without preconditions saves lives by getting them off the streets, critics say it ignores clients’ underlying problems and want to shift funding to groups like rescue missions that demand sobriety or employment. Some even blame Housing First for the growth in homelessness.“No more Housing First!” said Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky, after introducing a bill last month that would offer more money for programs with treatment mandates.Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, used two recent hearings to argue that Housing First ignores the root causes of homelessness. The Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group, is promoting model state legislation that bars Housing First programs from receiving state funds. A documentary it produced with PragerU, a conservative advocacy group, cuts between critiques of Housing First and footage of people living in tents on the street and shots of drug use.The escalating war over an obscure social service doctrine is partly an earnest policy dispute and partly an old-fashioned rivalry between groups seeking federal funds. But it is also a new ideological and political flashpoint, with former President Donald J. Trump and others on the right using it to to promote their argument that homelessness in liberal cities is an indictment of Democratic governance more broadly.Joe Lonsdale, the tech mogul behind the Cicero Institute, has called Housing First part of a “Marxist” attempt to blame homelessness on capitalism, and Mr. Trump, in seeking a return to office, has pledged to place homeless people in “tent cities.”“The attack on Housing First is the most worrisome thing I’ve seen in my 30 years in this field,” said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group with bipartisan roots. “When people have a safe and stable place to live, they can address other things in their lives. If critics succeed in defunding these successful programs, we’re going to see a lot more deaths on the street.”Until Housing First emerged a generation ago, services for homeless people were built on a staircase model: Clients were meant to progress from shelters to transitional programs, where training or treatment would ready them for permanent apartments. In practice, services were weak and failure rates high, with large numbers of noncompliant people returning to the streets.The new approach flipped the script, offering housing first — subsidized apartments with no preconditions — and hoped that residential stability would promote further advancement. Supporters emphasized that Housing First was not “housing only”: it included services like psychiatric treatment, but on a voluntary basis.Though skeptics feared that troubled people would leave or get evicted, early results were impressive.After five years, 88 percent of the clients in a New York City program called Pathways to Housing remained housed, compared to 47 percent in the usual system of care. Despite the lack of treatment mandates, Pathways clients were no more likely than those in the regular system to report mental illness or substance abuse. A large experiment covering five Canadian cities achieved similar results.Citing such studies, supporters praise Housing First as unusually “evidence based.”Contemporaneous research also offered hopes of cost savings. While most people entering shelters were quickly rehoused, work by Dennis Culhane of the University of Pennsylvania showed that a small minority became chronically homeless and consumed tens of thousands of dollars of services in jails and emergency rooms — roughly what it cost to house them. Supporters hoped Housing First would prove “not only more humane but for some people potentially cheaper,” Mr. Culhane said.Housing First exploded from a model to a movement under a Republican administration. Philip F. Mangano, the Bush administration’s top homelessness official, proved relentless in promoting Housing First programs, and the approach, which initially targeted the chronically homeless, broadened to a wider range of people experiencing homelessness.The Obama administration placed a preference for Housing First into the main federal grant programs, which now provide about $3 billion a year to local groups. From 2007 to 2016, chronic homelessness fell by more than a third.For social workers used to seeing people languish on the streets, a breakthrough seemed at hand.“I can still feel the emotion — ‘Wow, we can house everyone!’” said Adam Rocap, deputy director of Miriam’s Kitchen, a social services agency in Washington. Optimism about ending homelessness ran so high, he said, some of the agency’s staff members asked if they should seek other jobs.Since 2007, the stock of permanent supportive housing has more than doubled to 387,000 beds, while the Department of Housing and Urban Development found 582,000 people were homeless on a single night last year, and researchers estimate the number experiencing homelessness in a year could be three times as high.Some recent studies have noted limits on what the programs achieve. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018 found “no substantial evidence” that supportive housing improved clients’ health. Likewise, the medical journal The Lancet found “no measurable effect” on the severity of psychiatric problems, addiction, or employment.And despite hopes, the programs did not save money. Supportive housing is expensive to build (average costs in high-priced Los Angeles, which has an ambitious Housing First initiative, are nearly $600,000 per unit), and the share of unhoused people who consume costly services is low.Still, proponents say Housing First has succeeded where it matters most — getting people off the streets.“Getting people out of homelessness quickly is more important than anything, because life on the streets is so dangerous,” said Professor Culhane, of the University of Pennsylvania. “The evidence shows that Housing First is a very successful policy. Undoing it would be a disaster.”The growth in homelessness and the visibility of encampments in some locations have intensified debate. Since 2015, the unsheltered population has grown by about 35 percent, with California the center of the crisis. Most analysts say soaring rents play a major role. But critics fault Housing First for financing costly permanent housing instead of shelters that could serve more people, and for preventing treatment mandates they say would promote recovery and employment.“I thought it would help the few and leave thousands out on the streets, and my fears have been solidified,” said the Reverend Andy Bales, chief executive of the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles, which enforces sobriety rules and does not get federal funds.Housing First defenders scoff at the charge that it promotes homelessness.“Blaming Housing First for the rise in homelessness is like blaming aspirin for headaches,” said Jeff Olivet, head of the Biden administration’s Interagency Council on Homelessness.Mr. Olivet noted that the Department of Veterans Affairs has used Housing First policies — with more generous funding — and cut veterans’ homelessness since 2010 by more than half.“That’s a proof point for showing we can end homelessness and end it with a Housing First approach,” he said. “What we need to do is scale it up.”Like its predecessors, the Trump administration initially embraced Housing First, with the housing secretary, Ben Carson, praising a “mountain of data showing that a Housing First approach works.”That changed in 2019 as California’s homelessness crisis worsened and Mr. Trump began highlighting the issue to criticize the state’s “liberal establishment.”The Council of Economic Advisers issued a report skeptical of Housing First, and the Trump administration fired its homelessness coordinator, a holdover from the Obama years. His replacement, Robert Marbut, backed strict work and sobriety rules and said he favored “Housing Fourth.”In a recent interview, Mr. Marbut said he was brought in to “do everything we could to reverse Housing First.”But when the Trump administration tried to delete the Housing First preference in federal grants, congressional Democrats blocked the effort. With the coronavirus pandemic consuming the rest of Mr. Trump’s term, policy remained unchanged.Still a revolt had been seeded. Conservative literature on the topic emerged, with critiques from the Manhattan Institute, the Cicero Institute, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and a Heritage Foundation paper by Christopher F. Rufo, the activist who turned “critical race theory” into a war cry on the right.Tonally, the criticisms occupy two registers. Mr. Trump has described people experiencing homelessness as “violent and dangerously deranged,” and a Cicero Institute podcast asked whether phrases like “vagrants, bums, tramps” are preferable to “homeless.” But Cicero’s film offers sympathetic portraits of recovering addicts, and a former shelter director cries onscreen as she calls Housing First “one of the most oppressive things we’ve done” to the needy.Cicero’s work has drawn particular attention, given Mr. Lonsdale’s wealth as a co-founder of Palantir, the data-mining firm, and his support of conservative causes. The group’s model legislation restricts encampments to designated sites and blocks Housing First programs from state funds.“As an all-encompassing model for addressing homelessness, Housing First has failed,” said Judge Glock, who until recently led the group’s work.Texas and Georgia have adopted measures that enforce camping bans, and Missouri passed a broader Cicero-inspired bill last year, blocking Housing First programs from state funds. Its State Senate sponsor, Holly Thompson Rehder, a Republican, said concerns about the status quo had grown after an encampment fire under a Kansas City bridge killed one person and closed Interstate 70. Even in her rural district, campgrounds complained of losing business because customers feared encampments nearby.Ms. Rehder, who experienced homelessness as a child, said Cicero recruited her in part because of that history. Having watched relatives struggle with mental illness and addiction, she considered treatment mandates “a no-brainer.” The institute organized a study tour in Texas for her, and Mr. Glock testified for the bill.“They were incredibly helpful,” she said.In Congress, Mr. Barr, the Kentucky Republican, got involved after shelters in his Lexington-area district complained they could not get federal funding because of sobriety rules. He said residents told him they would have relapsed in less strict environments.But Mr. Olivet, the Biden administration official, said critics have forgotten how often services failed the homeless before Housing First came along.“Housing First saves lives every day,” he said. “It’s a proven intervention. We need more of it.”;Vance, Republican of Ohio, used two recent hearings to argue that Housing First ignores the root causes of homelessness.The Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group, is promoting model state legislation that bars Housing First programs from receiving state funds.A large experiment covering five Canadian cities achieved similar results.Citing such studies, supporters praise Housing First as unusually “evidence based.”Contemporaneous research also offered hopes of cost savings.;2023-06-20T09:01:35+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:32.200475+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60460;Trump Real Estate Deal in Oman Underscores Ethics Concerns;Details of the former president’s agreement to work with a Saudi firm to develop a hotel and golf complex overlooking the Gulf of Oman highlight the ways his business and political roles intersect.;On a remote site at the edge of the Gulf of Oman, thousands of migrant laborers from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are at work in 103-degree heat, toiling in shifts from dawn until nightfall to build a new city, a multibillion-dollar project backed by Oman’s oil-rich government that has an unusual partner: former President Donald J. Trump.Mr. Trump’s name is plastered on signs at the entrance of the project and in the lobby of the InterContinental Hotel in Muscat, the nearby capital of Oman, where a team of sales agents is invoking Mr. Trump’s name to help sell luxury villas at prices of up to $13 million, mostly targeting superrich buyers from around the world, including from Russia, Iran and India.Mr. Trump has been selling his name to global real estate developers for more than a decade. But the Oman deal has taken his financial stake in one of the world’s most strategically important and volatile regions to a new level, underscoring how his business and his politics intersect as he runs for president again amid intensifying legal and ethical troubles.Interviews and an examination by The New York Times of hundreds of pages of financial documents associated with the Oman project show that this partnership is unlike any other international deal Mr. Trump and his family have signed.The venture puts Mr. Trump in business with the government of Oman, an ally of the United States with which Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, cultivated ties while in office and which plays a vital diplomatic role in a volatile region. The Omani government is providing the land for the development, is investing heavily in the infrastructure to support it and will get a cut of the profits in the long run.Mr. Trump was brought into the deal by a Saudi real estate firm, Dar Al Arkan, which is closely intertwined with the Saudi government. While in office, Mr. Trump developed a tight relationship with Saudi leaders. Since leaving office, he has worked with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund to host the LIV golf tour and Mr. Kushner received a $2 billion infusion from the Saudi fund for his investment venture.Mr. Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, has already brought in at least $5 million from the Oman deal. Under its terms, Trump Organization will not put up any money for the development, but will help design a Trump-branded hotel, golf course and golf club and will be paid to manage them for up to 30 years, among other revenue.The project could also draw scrutiny in the West for its treatment of its migrant workers, who during the first phase of construction are living in compounds of cramped trailers in a desertlike setting and are being paid as little as $340 a month, according to one of the engineers supervising the work.Mr. Trump’s business ties in the Middle East have already been under intense scrutiny. Federal prosecutors who brought criminal charges against him in the case stemming from his mishandling of classified documents issued subpoenas for information about his foreign deals and the agreements with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour.During his presidency, Mr. Trump’s family business profited directly from money spent at his Washington hotel by foreign governments including Saudi Arabia, just one example of what ethics experts cited as real or perceived conflicts of interest during his administration. His stake in the project in Oman as he runs for president again only focuses more attention on whether and how his own financial interests could influence foreign policy were he to return to the White House.“This is as blatant as it comes,” said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit group that has investigated Mr. Trump’s foreign deals. “How and when is he going to sell out U.S. interests? That is the question this creates. It is the kind of corruption our founding fathers most worried about.”In February, Eric Trump, the former president’s son who is overseeing the project for Trump Organization while also playing a role in his father’s re-election campaign, traveled to Oman to visit the cliff-side site where the golf course will soon be built. He met with executives from Dar Al Arkan, the Saudi firm, as well as top government officials from Oman who control the land.“It’s like the Hamptons of the Middle East,” Eric Trump said in an interview, declining to address other questions about the project.Oman, in fact, is nothing like the Hamptons. It is a Muslim nation and absolute monarchy, ruled by a sultan, who plays a sensitive role in the Middle East: Oman maintains close ties with Saudi Arabia and its allies, but also with Iran, with which it has considerable trade.As a result, Oman has often served as an interlocutor for the West with Iran, including in the lead-up to the 2015 agreement the Obama administration and other Western governments negotiated with Iran to slow its move to build nuclear weapons, a deal Mr. Trump later abandoned. In recent months, Oman has hosted indirect talks to try to ease tensions between Iran and the United States.Oman is also a buyer of weapons from the United States, including Lockheed Martin’s F-16 fighter jets and a Raytheon-manufactured missile system that it agreed to purchase last year. Mr. Trump, while at the White House, had sent Mr. Kushner to Oman in 2019 to meet with Sultan Qaboos bin Said, then the nation’s monarch, to discuss the Arab-Israeli dispute.IRANPersianGulfQATARGulf of OmanYitiU.A.E.MuscatWADi MAYHSAUDI ARABIAOMANArabianSeaYEMEN200 milesBy The New York TimesMr. Trump later reached out to Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, who took over as the new sultan in 2020, to praise “the success of the first eight months” of his rule and to discuss ways to “strengthen the Oman-U.S. bilateral economic partnership,” according to a White House summary of the call.Mr. Trump did not pursue any new international real estate deals while in office, but his search for deep-pocketed international partners picked up when he left the White House in January 2021, his reputation at home tarnished by the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. And it was through Dar Al Arkan, the Saudi real estate company, that Mr. Trump and his family firm got into the Oman project.The government of Oman had chosen Dar Al Arkan to run the second phase of the Yiti project, which covers a vast stretch of coastline east of the capital city. Hashil bin Obaid Al Mahrouqi, the chief executive of the Omani government agency that oversees the Yiti project, said it was Dar Al Arkan’s choice to bring in Mr. Trump, but he added that international brands like Mr. Trump’s would help bring global attention — and sales — to the project.“Helping us to accelerate the delivery of the project, accelerate also the return of the project, to accelerate the selling of the project,” Mr. Al Mahrouqi said, speaking from the conference room of a beachfront W Hotel that his agency also developed in Oman. “What is good for the project is good for us.”Mr. Trump was on hand to close the deal in New York in November, just before he announced his 2024 presidential bid. Executives from the Saudi real estate company visited Trump Tower and showed off designs for the project, and Eric Trump signed paperwork confirming the deal.“Our partnership with Trump will distinguish our first project in Oman and put it on the global map,” Yousef Al Shelash, the chairman of Dar Al Arkan, said in a statement issued as the deal was signed.Neither Dar Al Arkan nor the Trump Organization would say how much the Trump family would be paid. In previous international deals, the family has traditionally taken a fee in exchange for the use of its name, a separate fee to manage the hotel and golf properties, and a percentage of the profits on the sale of Trump-branded villas, if the prices hit a goal.In Oman, the government’s contribution to the Yiti project starts with the land: It has set aside nearly 3,000 acres along the Gulf of Oman for the project, a quarter of which it has turned over to the Saudi-run Dar Al Arkan. The Omani government will be paid back over time for the land, and get a cut of the profits from the project, according to a detailed description of the deal made public in a financial filing in London.Separately, the government of Oman is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade highways and utilities, and to sponsor the first phase of the project, which includes a Nikki Beach resort hotel that is already being built adjacent to where the Trump golf course and hotel are planned.“What you see in front of you — that’s a billion dollars’ worth of investments,” said Ammar Al Kharusi, the head of development at the Oman government’s tourism agency, as he stood on the edge of a cliff that overlooked the first phase of the Yiti project, where hundreds of workers toiled below, as countless trucks and at least a dozen cranes hauled in and lifted loads of steel and other building supplies to construct this new metropolis.Next door is the second phase — called Oceana at Aida — that will be built by Dar Al Arkan on a desertlike plateau towering nearly 450 feet above the Gulf of Oman, offering extraordinary views.The area historically has been known for what is called Wadi Mayh, a ravine that remains dry most of the year, but whose raging waters during the region’s occasional rains have left elaborate rock formations that create spectacular natural vistas. Dar Al Arkan and the Trump Organization now want to build luxury hotels, golf course and townhouses overlooking the austere landscape.Dar Al Arkan was founded nearly three decades ago by Saudi real estate executives who bought up land for future housing developments, and it eventually became a large-scale home builder itself.It maintains extremely close ties with the Saudi government.Dar Al Arkan is one of the country’s most important beneficiaries of a decision more than a decade ago by Saudi Arabia to pump in billions of dollars of government funds to help create a modern, mortgage-backed housing industry in an effort to expand homeownership. It is also a major investor in Saudi Home Loans Company, which has profited as government dollars flow into the mortgage industry.Dar Al Arkan more recently moved into international luxury real-estate development, this time through a London-based subsidiary it set up called DarGlobal.DarGlobal is teaming up with luxury brands like Missoni, Versace and Lamborghini — as well as the Trump family — on projects outside Saudi Arabia targeting international buyers. DarGlobal is targeting buyers who will pay as much as a 30 percent premium for a “branded” townhouse and can often buy their units with cash, according to a confidential company document obtained by The Times.“There is a big wealth concentration in the world, which means that those people will more and more demand more exclusive products and more exclusive projects,” Ziad El Chaar, DarGlobal’s chief executive, told real estate developers in France this year.Mr. El Chaar had worked with the Trump family in Dubai, building a Trump International Golf Club. Pleased with that project, he asked the Trump family to join him in Oman, in what will be DarGlobal’s largest international project, worth an estimated $4 billion.The 30-year agreement between DarGlobal and the Trump family designates the Trump Organization as the hotel manager that will “direct the management and operation of a world-class, superluxury hotel to be constructed by Dar Oman within its Aida project in Oman.” The deal puts the Trump company in charge of the hotel budget, its restaurants and any retail stores. The Trump Organization will set prices and market the hotel once it opens under the name Trump International Hotel Oman.It will have similar management rights over the 18-hole golf course and golf club, which will be known as Trump International Golf Club Oman. There will also be over 200 “Trump branded residential villas,” according to one company document published in January, and marked confidential.The Trump family, the agreement says, will not have to commit its own money to the project, but it will have detailed oversight including reviewing a “model room” that DarGlobal will build to sign off on the design.“Dar Oman will design, develop, construct, equip and furnish the hotel, at its sole cost and expenses, in accordance with the specifications, standards and requirements issued from time to time by the hotel manager,” the financial documents say, referring to the Trump Organization.More than 1,000 migrant laborers are busy in the searing heat building the first phase of the Oman government’s Yiti project. Next door, at the Aida site, where the Trump-branded phase of the project will eventually rise, work on the roads is just beginning.The army of workers, in orange, blue or yellow overalls, move deliberately, many of them with their heads covered with towels and other fabrics stuffed under their hard hats to try to protect themselves from the heat, routinely above 100 degrees, during 10-hour shifts. They live mostly in trailer camps adjacent to the construction site, or they arrive in fleets of buses that run through the billowing clouds of dust that blow through.Like other Middle Eastern nations, Oman has drawn scrutiny for its treatment of foreign workers. In a report last year, the State Department listed “labor exploitation of foreign migrants” as among the human rights issues it is monitoring in Oman.Some low-skilled migrant workers in fields including construction “faced working conditions indicative of forced labor,” said the report, which went on to say that Oman has “appropriate” safety and health labor standards that, it noted, an advocacy group said were not always enforced for foreign workers.One recent afternoon, the migrant workers came marching out of the site of the first phase during a shift change, walking right past a giant sign promising “Coming Soon to Aida, Trump International Golf Club, Oman” showing renderings of a carefully manicured golf course to be carved from the desertlike land.In tiny print at the bottom of the site, it also said, “Trump International Golf Club Oman is not owned, developed or sold by Donald J. Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump,” noting that this site was run by DarGlobal.“It’s too hot — too hot,” said Mathan Mp, 38, who is from Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India, said as he took a break from supervising dozens of workers at the project site. “But we came for work. We have a time schedule. We have to finish the project.”Omani officials said they would closely monitor working conditions for the laborers, adding that during the hottest weeks of the summer the workers would not be at the site in the middle of the day.Executives at DarGlobal, Dar Al Arkan and the Trump Organization declined to comment.The Trump-branded project is being built just above the seaside village of Yiti, where there are now more donkeys, goats and stray cats in the streets than people, as many have moved away as the construction projects have accelerated.The few remaining residents do not know a great deal about Mr. Trump, having only a general impression of him as a rich businessman and politician.Htim Talbi, whose family has lived in Yiti for six decades and remains in one of the few occupied homes in the dusty town, said he harbored a far-off dream that he might somehow afford one of the luxury townhouses.“Trump — he is your king from America,” Mr. Talbi said, after inviting a visitor to his village inside to an air-conditioned room to sit on the floor and share a pot of tea. “Welcome to Oman.”;Trump was brought into the deal by a Saudi real estate firm, Dar Al Arkan, which is closely intertwined with the Saudi government.Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, has already brought in at least $5 million from the Oman deal.El Chaar had worked with the Trump family in Dubai, building a Trump International Golf Club.;2023-06-20T13:47:42+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:32.730113+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60461;Donald Trump Says ‘Secret’ Document He Described on Tape Referred to News Clippings;“There was no document,” the former president said on Fox News as he gave some of his most expansive remarks on the case that led to his federal indictment.;Former President Donald J. Trump claimed to a Fox News anchor in an interview on Monday that he did not have a classified document with him in a meeting with a book publisher even though he referred during that meeting to “secret” information in his possession.The July 2021 meeting — at Mr. Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J. — was recorded by at least two people in attendance, and a transcript describes the former president pointing to a pile of papers and then saying of Gen. Mark A. Milley, whom he had been criticizing: “Look. This was him. They presented me this — this is off the record, but — they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him.”On the recording, according to two people familiar with its contents, Mr. Trump can be heard flipping through papers as he talks to a publisher and writer working on a book by his final White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Mr. Trump and the people in the meeting do not explicitly say what document the former president is holding.According to the transcript, Mr. Trump describes the document, which he claims shows General Milley’s desire to attack Iran, as “secret” and “like, highly confidential.” He also declares that “as president, I could have declassified it,” adding, “Now I can’t, you know, but this is still a secret.”But in the interview on Monday, with the Fox News anchor Bret Baier, Mr. Trump denied that he had been referring to an actual document and claimed to have simply been referring to news clippings and magazine pieces.“There was no document,” Mr. Trump insisted. “That was a massive amount of papers and everything else talking about Iran and other things. And it may have been held up or may not, but that was not a document. I didn’t have a document per se. There was nothing to declassify. These were newspaper stories, magazine stories and articles.”Apparently playing down the information from the recording, he added, “I don’t think that I’ve ever seen a document from Milley.”The audio recording is a key piece of evidence in an indictment charging Mr. Trump with illegally holding on to 31 sensitive government documents, some of which were highly classified and included information about U.S. nuclear and military capabilities. The indictment was filed this month by Jack Smith, a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, in Federal District Court in Miami. The indictment also accused Mr. Trump of conspiring with one of his aides, Walt Nauta, to evade a grand jury subpoena issued last May for all classified material in his possession.A description of a typewritten document by General Milley appears in Mr. Meadows’s book, unattributed and stated as fact.Criminal defendants usually avoid speaking publicly about details of any charges in their case, for fear of their remarks being used against them. The interview was broadcast on the same day that a federal magistrate judge in Mr. Trump’s case issued a protective order instructing him not to reveal any evidence that had been turned over to his legal team as part of the discovery process.While the interview did not seem to violate that order, his remarks represented some of his most expansive comments about the nearly two years that federal officials spent trying to retrieve material from his presidency that belongs to the government. The comments were also the latest in a string of shifting stories that he and his allies have offered since it became public that officials at the National Archives and Records Administration recovered 15 boxes of material from Mr. Trump in January 2022.Earlier in the interview with Mr. Baier, Mr. Trump appeared to concede that even after the Justice Department issued a subpoena last year for all classified documents in his possession, he delayed complying with it in order to separate any personal records that might have been among them.“Before I send boxes over, I have to take all of my things out,” Mr. Trump said. “These boxes were interspersed with all sorts of things.”Mr. Trump also acknowledged that he did not immediately comply with an earlier request to return government records to the archives, telling Mr. Baier that he gave the archives “some” and maintaining, “I was very busy, as you’ve sort of seen.”A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In February 2022, after the public learned that Mr. Trump had returned classified material to the archives, the former president directed aides to issue a statement saying he had returned everything to the government. The final statement the Trump team released did not make this claim.But the draft version of that statement became a focus of prosecutors who were entering evidence and hearing testimony before a grand jury in Florida, according to two people familiar with the matter.Mr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination for 2024, and his allies have offered evolving explanations for his possession of classified material and repeated refusals to return it. He has insisted the documents all belonged to him as personal records. He has also claimed that he declassified everything he removed before it left the White House, through a so-called standing order that material was declassified when it left the Oval Office to go to the White House residence. Former senior White House officials said no such order existed.And last month, Mr. Trump’s lawyers wrote a letter to Congress saying that his staff “quickly packed everything into boxes and shipped them to Florida,” leaving the impression that Mr. Trump himself did not go through the material and was unaware of what was in the boxes when they were packed.The indictment contradicted that claim, with prosecutors saying that Mr. Trump was “personally involved in this process” and “caused his boxes, containing hundreds of classified documents, to be transported from the White House to the Mar-a-Lago club.”In his interview with Mr. Baier, the former president indicated that he did sort through some boxes after they were sent from Washington to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida.At one point, Mr. Baier asked Mr. Trump why he did not simply hand the material over.“I want to go through the boxes and get all my personal things out,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t want to hand that over to NARA yet.”;The indictment was filed this month by Jack Smith, a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, in Federal District Court in Miami.“These boxes were interspersed with all sorts of things.”Mr.Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination for 2024, and his allies have offered evolving explanations for his possession of classified material and repeated refusals to return it.;2023-06-20T00:45:36+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:33.393433+00:00;668;Politics;1267;The Funny Times
60468;Quantum Computing Advance Begins New Era, IBM Says;A quantum computer came up with better answers to a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.;Quantum computers today are small in computational scope — the chip inside your smartphone contains billions of transistors while the most powerful quantum computer contains a few hundred of the quantum equivalent of a transistor. They are also unreliable. If you run the same calculation over and over, they will most likely churn out different answers each time.But with their intrinsic ability to consider many possibilities at once, quantum computers do not have to be very large to tackle certain prickly problems of computation, and on Wednesday, IBM researchers announced that they had devised a method to manage the unreliability in a way that would lead to reliable, useful answers.“What IBM showed here is really an amazingly important step in that direction of making progress towards serious quantum algorithmic design,” said Dorit Aharonov, a professor of computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who was not involved with the research.While researchers at Google in 2019 claimed that they had achieved “quantum supremacy” — a task performed much more quickly on a quantum computer than a conventional one — IBM’s researchers say they have achieved something new and more useful, albeit more modestly named.“We’re entering this phase of quantum computing that I call utility,” said Jay Gambetta, a vice president of IBM Quantum. “The era of utility.”A team of IBM scientists who work for Dr. Gambetta described their results in a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.Present-day computers are called digital, or classical, because they deal with bits of information that are either 1 or 0, on or off. A quantum computer performs calculations on quantum bits, or qubits, that capture a more complex state of information. Just as a thought experiment by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger postulated that a cat could be in a quantum state that is both dead and alive, a qubit can be both 1 and 0 simultaneously.That allows quantum computers to make many calculations in one pass, while digital ones have to perform each calculation separately. By speeding up computation, quantum computers could potentially solve big, complex problems in fields like chemistry and materials science that are out of reach today. Quantum computers could also have a darker side by threatening privacy through algorithms that break the protections used for passwords and encrypted communications.When Google researchers made their supremacy claim in 2019, they said their quantum computer performed a calculation in 3 minutes 20 seconds that would take about 10,000 years on a state-of-the-art conventional supercomputer.But some other researchers, including those at IBM, discounted the claim, saying the problem was contrived. “Google’s experiment, as impressive it was, and it was really impressive, is doing something which is not interesting for any applications,” said Dr. Aharonov, who also works as the chief scientific officer of Qedma, a quantum computing company.The Google computation also turned out to be less impressive than it first appeared. A team of Chinese researchers was able to perform the same calculation on a non-quantum supercomputer in just over five minutes, far quicker than the 10,000 years the Google team had estimated.The IBM researchers in the new study performed a different task, one that interests physicists. They used a quantum processor with 127 qubits to simulate the behavior of 127 atom-scale bar magnets — tiny enough to be governed by the spooky rules of quantum mechanics — in a magnetic field. That is a simple system known as the Ising model, which is often used to study magnetism.This problem is too complex for a precise answer to be calculated even on the largest, fastest supercomputers.On the quantum computer, the calculation took less than a thousandth of a second to complete. Each quantum calculation was unreliable — fluctuations of quantum noise inevitably intrude and induce errors — but each calculation was quick, so it could be performed repeatedly.Indeed, for many of the calculations, additional noise was deliberately added, making the answers even more unreliable. But by varying the amount of noise, the researchers could tease out the specific characteristics of the noise and its effects at each step of the calculation.“We can amplify the noise very precisely, and then we can rerun that same circuit,” said Abhinav Kandala, the manager of quantum capabilities and demonstrations at IBM Quantum and an author of the Nature paper. “And once we have results of these different noise levels, we can extrapolate back to what the result would have been in the absence of noise.”In essence, the researchers were able to subtract the effects of noise from the unreliable quantum calculations, a process they call error mitigation.“You have to bypass that by inventing very clever ways to mitigate the noise,” Dr. Aharonov said. “And this is what they do.”Altogether, the computer performed the calculation 600,000 times, converging on an answer for the overall magnetization produced by the 127 bar magnets.But how good was the answer?For help, the IBM team turned to physicists at the University of California, Berkeley. Although an Ising model with 127 bar magnets is too big, with far too many possible configurations, to fit in a conventional computer, classical algorithms can produce approximate answers, a technique similar to how compression in JPEG images throws away less crucial data to reduce the size of the file while preserving most of the image’s details.Michael Zaletel, a physics professor at Berkeley and an author of the Nature paper, said that when he started working with IBM, he thought his classical algorithms would do better than the quantum ones.“It turned out a little bit differently than I expected,” Dr. Zaletel said.Certain configurations of the Ising model can be solved exactly, and both the classical and quantum algorithms agreed on the simpler examples. For more complex but solvable instances, the quantum and classical algorithms produced different answers, and it was the quantum one that was correct.Thus, for other cases where the quantum and classical calculations diverged and no exact solutions are known, “there is reason to believe that the quantum result is more accurate,” said Sajant Anand, a graduate student at Berkeley who did much of the work on the classical approximations.It is not clear that quantum computing is indisputably the winner over classical techniques for the Ising model.Mr. Anand is currently trying to add a version of error mitigation for the classical algorithm, and it is possible that could match or surpass the performance of the quantum calculations.“It’s not obvious that they’ve achieved quantum supremacy here,” Dr. Zaletel said.In the long run, quantum scientists expect that a different approach, error correction, will be able to detect and correct calculation mistakes, and that will open the door for quantum computers to speed ahead for many uses.Error correction is already used in conventional computers and data transmission to fix garbles. But for quantum computers, error correction is likely years away, requiring better processors able to process many more qubits.Error mitigation, the IBM scientists believe, is an interim solution that can be used now for increasingly complex problems beyond the Ising model.“This is one of the simplest natural science problems that exists,” Dr. Gambetta said. “So it’s a good one to start with. But now the question is, how do you generalize it and go to more interesting natural science problems?”Those might include figuring out the properties of exotic materials, accelerating drug discovery and modeling fusion reactions.;A quantum computer performs calculations on quantum bits, or qubits, that capture a more complex state of information.By speeding up computation, quantum computers could potentially solve big, complex problems in fields like chemistry and materials science that are out of reach today.“So it’s a good one to start with.;2023-06-20T03:32:13+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:36.792241+00:00;1923;Science;1267;The Funny Times
60472;Our Plan to Attract a Flock of Birders;In its first-ever citizen science project, The Times is encouraging readers to go birding and help researchers gather data on the avian world.;"We would not count ourselves as birders. Elaine, who visited the Everglades occasionally when she lived in Miami, knows a purple gallinule when she sees one. Alan can tell a red-tailed hawk from a sharp-shinned one, having been dragged as a child every spring to the southern shore of Lake Ontario to watch raptors migrate north. But such traits alone do not a birder make.We do consider ourselves bird and science enthusiasts. So in May, we began inviting Times readers from across the globe to share observations about the birds in their areas. The Times has a long history of engaging its readers, but to our knowledge this was (probably) its first participatory citizen science project.For years, we had been looking for the right moment to start such a project. Scientists are eager to engage with the public, and every reader’s observations contribute to a greater understanding in some area of research. We wanted an activity that would help readers see the effects of climate change in their neighborhoods, and we wanted readers’ contributions to feed into a collective effort that could bring people together, albeit virtually.Birds seemed like the right subject for engagement. They exist almost everywhere. They’re dinosaurs with feathers. They’re pollinators, pest controllers and transporters of seeds. They connect distant ecosystems, and they connect the birders who observe them. Many species are threatened by climate change, pollution and habitat loss.And while birds are widely studied, there is still much more to be learned about them. We knew that Times readers could help, by birding and sharing what they saw. The gathering of bird data tends to quiet down in the summer, after spring migration. A summer birding project seemed like a fun way to introduce beginners to the joys of birding and to a community of more experienced birders.So, with the help of scientists at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, we’ll soon start sending out weekly prompts, with activities — an invitation to try identifying birds by their calls, for instance — and guidance on collecting bird data throughout the summer. (You can sign up here.)The information that readers gather will be added to Cornell’s open access database. For its part, The Times will provide readers with updates on scientific insights; organize free events, including a conversation on June 22 with the authors Amy Tan and Christian Cooper about the joys and benefits of birding; and report on birds in the news, like the majestic, vanishing kestrel that Catrin Einhorn wrote about this month.Before we began this project, we were aware that passionate birding communities existed. Camille Baker, a news assistant on the events team who recently wrote an article about the increasing number of black vultures in New York City, is an ardent birder who attends outings with like-minded watchers in the city and beyond. The number of legacy and newer organizations committed to birding and conservation gave us hope that the project would resonate.So far, readers have already been enthusiastic about our Summer of Birds, and various departments at The Times have gotten involved, including Climate, Metro and The New York Times for Kids. But for us, one of the most delightful aspects of this work has been discovering how many of our Times colleagues are bird enthusiasts. It turns out there’s a very active #birding channel on the company Slack platform, where people from across The Times chime in with their bird sightings.A couple of weeks ago, Matt Kaiser, from the brand team at The Times, shared a small personal victory in the Slack channel: “After 19 unsuccessful attempts, in four states over three years, I finally got a good look at my arch nemesis, the hooded warbler!” Others have posted photos of birds they’ve been lucky enough to see: pelicans, wrens, herons; a barred owl, a white-faced ibis, a northern shoveler, a Townsend’s solitaire; and even Flaco, the Eurasian eagle-owl that escaped from the Central Park Zoo and could be viewed (with great effort) in the park at large.The channel is like an in-house bird feeder, and everyone’s flocking to it to share photos, stories of sightings and just to enjoy one another’s company. Birds have that effect — and we want to share that feeling with readers, too.";So in May, we began inviting Times readers from across the globe to share observations about the birds in their areas.We knew that Times readers could help, by birding and sharing what they saw.But for us, one of the most delightful aspects of this work has been discovering how many of our Times colleagues are bird enthusiasts.;2023-06-21T07:00:15+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:38.704147+00:00;1923;Science;1267;The Funny Times
60473;Collective Force of Head Hits Increases Odds of CTE, Study Says;The largest study of chronic traumatic encephalopathy to date found that the cumulative force of head hits absorbed by players in their careers is the best predictor of future brain disease.;When Jeffrey Vlk played running back in high school in the 1990s and then safety in college, he took and delivered countless tackles during full-contact football practices. Hitting was a mainstay, as were injuries, including concussions.When he became a coach at Buffalo Grove High School outside Chicago in 2005, Vlk did what he had been taught: He had his players hit and tackle in practices to “toughen them up.”By the time he became head coach in 2016, though, he saw that many of his players were so banged up from a week of hitting in practice that they missed games or were more susceptible to being injured in those games.So, starting in 2019, Vlk eliminated full-contact practices. Players wore shoulder pads once a week, on Wednesday, which he called contact day. That’s when they hit tackle bags and crash pads, and wrapped up teammates but did not throw them to the ground. Vlk said no starting player had been injured at his practices in four years.“Those types of injuries can stay with you for a long time,” he said, “and knowing that I’m keeping the kids safe, not just in our program, but beyond the program, is reason enough to go this route.”Vlk’s approach to limiting the number of hits players take has been spreading slowly in the football world, where much of the effort has focused on avoiding and treating concussions, which often have observable symptoms and are tracked by sports leagues.But researchers have for years posited that the more hits to the head a player receives — even subconcussive ones, which are usually not tracked — the more likely he is to develop cognitive and neurological problems later in life.A new study published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Nature Communications added a critical wrinkle: A football player’s chances of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., are related to the number of head impacts absorbed, but also to the cumulative impact of all those hits.Researchers in a new study estimated the cumulative force of head impacts absorbed by 631 former football players who donated their brains to studies overseen by researchers at Boston University. Those players who absorbed the most cumulative force from head hits had the worst forms of C.T.E.No C.TE..Stage 1 C.T.E.Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4100% ofplayersstudied80%60%40%20%Less cumulative forceMore cumulative forceNo C.T.E.Stage 1 C.T.E.Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4100% ofplayersstudied80%60%40%20%Less cumulative forceMore cumulative forceNo C.T.E.Stage 1 C.T.E.Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4100% ofplayersstudied80%60%40%20%Less total forceMore total forceThe study, the largest to look at the causes of C.T.E. to date, used data published in 34 studies that tracked the number and magnitude of head hits measured by football helmet sensors. Using the data, which went back 20 years, the scientists estimated the number and force of head hits absorbed by 631 former football players who donated their brains to studies overseen by researchers at Boston University.The paper tried to address one of the most persistent challenges for brain trauma researchers: identifying what aspects of head hits contribute most to C.T.E. They looked at the number of hits to the head, the number of years playing football, the force of those hits and other factors.The best predictor of brain disease later in life, the study found, was the cumulative force of the head hits absorbed by the players over the course of their careers, not the number of diagnosed concussions.“We’re now getting a better understanding of what causes C.T.E. pathology, but we’re also getting a better understanding of what’s not causing C.T.E. pathology,” said Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the study. “And in this case, it’s the largest study of C.T.E. pathology ever, and concussions were basically noise.”Of the 631 brains examined, 451 players, or 71 percent, were found to have C.T.E., while 180 did not. The players who were estimated to have absorbed the greatest cumulative force had the worst forms of C.T.E., which has been associated with symptoms including memory loss, impulsive behavior, depression and suicidal thoughts.This table shows the number of head hits and the average force of impacts experienced by high school football players, according to the results of the study. The researchers used tables like this to estimate a player’s lifetime exposure to head hits based on the positions they played at each level.Linemen, who collide on nearly every play, had the most hits per season.Other positions had fewer hits, but each hit was harder on average.Eric Nauman, a biomedical engineering professor at the University of Cincinnati who was not involved in the study, said the results strengthened the idea that an accumulation of subconcussive hits, rather than concussions, was the driving force behind long-term cognitive decline.The latest data “seems to support the idea that, yes, all these hits matter, they all add up,” Dr. Nauman said. “If you accumulate damage faster than the body can repair it, now you’ve got a problem.”He said the analysis pointed the way toward obvious changes that could make football safer, like the elimination of hitting in practices and the development of helmets that absorb more impact, especially to the back of the head.Dr. Nauman noted that the new study included brains of players with and without the disease, sparing it from the common concern that the researchers looked only at the most damaged brains.It also found links between the estimated number and types of hits players sustained during their careers and their health many years later, a factor Dr. Nauman said would make it more difficult for detractors to argue that players had possibly suffered unknown injuries in the decades after they stopped playing football that caused later cognitive problems.Dr. Nauman said the new research was still bound by limitations. The study counted all of the head impacts detected by helmet sensors, except for those caused by jostling or incidental motion. But previous research has suggested that the most important hits appeared to be those above a certain threshold, a distinction the study was not able to make.The study used G-force as a measure of the linear acceleration experienced during a head hit. This table compares the intensity of a football hit and other kinds of impact.Because the N.F.L. has not published its helmet sensor data, the study used college sensor data as a proxy for professional players.Helmets have improved in recent years, and it is likely that players whose careers predate the improvements absorbed more of the impact from any given hit. But football players in decades past were on average smaller and slower than those playing today, making any given hit less forceful, Dr. Nauman said.“That certainly is a caveat, but it’s not something that would make me think the basic conclusions are wrong,” he said.Joseph J. Crisco, a professor at Brown University who helped devise a sensor used in Riddell helmets, said the study tried to overcome a basic challenge — that researchers had not tracked how many hits the brain donors had accumulated during their careers.Rather, the study used helmet sensor data from a more recent set of players to estimate the number and force of head impacts for the older players, based on what positions they played, at what levels of the sport and for how long.While studies using players’ actual lifetime head impacts were needed, he said, the findings suggest that “the players that are getting hit the hardest and most often are more likely to have C.T.E. down the road.”Steve Rowson, who studies helmet impacts and concussion risk at Virginia Tech, said the study’s emphasis on the force and number of hits that players sustain fits with how scientists understand brain injuries.This table shows the increased risk of developing C.T.E. for each additional year played compared with someone who played only two years of youth football. Players who absorb more head hits, like linemen who play for many years, are at higher risk for the disease.Note: The study used college sensor data to estimate the risk for professional players.“Every time you hit your head, your brain undergoes some loading, and there’s going to be a pressure response and a brain strain response — a stretching of the brain tissue,” he said. “And if you exceed some threshold, you would expect some injury response, and the severity of that injury response is going to be dependent on the acceleration values.”Researchers have managed to pinpoint some factors that explain different players’ exposure to head impacts, he said. For example, he said, linemen are most often hit on the fronts of their helmets, while quarterbacks are more likely to suffer severe impacts to the backs of theirs.But, Dr. Rowson said, it would be a mistake for people to think that they could now use the findings to predict anyone’s chances of long-term cognitive problems.“What I don’t think we can do right now is look at an individual and really get a good idea of their head impact exposure relative to another,” he said, “because there’s this huge difference person to person that we can’t quite account for.”The study notes that future research should examine different thresholds for counting hits, an advancement that Dr. Rowson said was important. Some head impacts, he said, are mild enough that the brain can probably tolerate them. But at exactly what point the impacts become damaging is not clear, he said.“Not all impacts are created equal,” he said. “Trying to figure out which impacts are the most important, I think, could really help this kind of analysis.”;to date, used data published in 34 studies that tracked the number and magnitude of head hits measured by football helmet sensors.The study counted all of the head impacts detected by helmet sensors, except for those caused by jostling or incidental motion.Some head impacts, he said, are mild enough that the brain can probably tolerate them.;2023-06-20T15:37:08+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:39.127273+00:00;1923;Science;1267;The Funny Times
60474;Rising Temperatures Speeding Up Himalayan Glacier Loss;Glaciers in the region melted faster between 2010 and 2019 than in the previous decade. “Things are just happening so fast,” one researcher said.;"New research from scientists in Nepal confirms that ice and snow in the world’s highest mountains are disappearing as a result of rising temperatures and at a faster pace than previously thought. The report from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Kathmandu finds that glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountain range region melted 65 percent faster from 2010 through 2019 than in the previous decade.The finding adds to a growing body of evidence that the consequences of climate change are speeding up, and that some changes will be irreversible.Nearly two billion people who live in more than a dozen countries within the mountain region or in the river valleys downstream depend on melting ice and snow for their water supply. Melting glaciers are destabilizing the landscape and raising the risks of hazards like floods and landslides. These rapid changes are squeezing much of the region’s unique wildlife into smaller and more precarious habitats. For some unlucky species, it’s already too late.“Things are happening quickly,” said Miriam Jackson, a cryosphere researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and one of the authors of the report. “Just from two decades ago to the last decade, there’s been quite big changes. And I think that’s a surprise for lots of people, that things are just happening so fast.”Dr. Jackson and her colleagues studied an area of approximately 1.6 million square miles that they call the Hindu Kush Himalaya, stretching from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east. Their research was funded in part by the federal governments of several countries in the region, which are scrambling to understand how climate change is affecting their natural resources and how their citizens might adapt.A second report released Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service also recorded significant glacier loss. In 2022, glaciers in the European Alps experienced a record amount of ice mass lost in a single year, according to The State of the Climate in Europe 2022.The new Himalayan report updates work published by the same group in 2019, which found that even in the most optimistic case that average global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels, the Hindu Kush Himalaya would lose at least one-third of its glaciers. This estimate remains the same, but improved satellite data since have allowed for more precise measurements of how much the region’s glaciers have already shrunk, and better projections of how fast they might shrivel beyond 1.5 degrees of warming.“Technically speaking, I think it’s amazing,” said Marco Tedesco, a professor of marine geology at Columbia University who was not involved in the research. Dr. Tedesco also praised the new report’s focus on the societal and ecological implications of fast-melting glaciers. It’s a welcome sign, he said, that public attention on global warming is shifting away from a narrow scientific focus on physical changes to a broader understanding of how these changes will affect people around the world.As these mountain glaciers shrink, meltwater will increase — for a little while. The system will eventually reach a point, around approximately 2050, when the glaciers have shrunk so much that their meltwater starts to dwindle, the report said. The researchers call this turning point “peak water.”The timing and locations of meltwater in the region will change, too.“There will be too much water in some places and there will be too little water in some places,” said Santosh Nepal, a researcher at the International Water Management Institute and another author of the report.For now, meltwater will start to become available earlier in the year. Dr. Nepal expects that as climate change makes rainfall patterns more erratic around the world, people in the Hindu Kush Himalaya will depend more on meltwater in place of rainwater — even though this meltwater can’t be relied on for more than 20 or 30 years.As the glaciers melt, there are other risks to people. Natural hazards, already a fact of life in the mountains, would become worse. Eroding mountain slopes and hillsides would set the stage for cascading disasters like floods and landslides when sudden shocks to the system, like earthquakes, occur.Emergency preparedness and response systems in the region “are not designed to cope with that kind of disasters,” Dr. Nepal said.The ecosystems of the Hindu Kush Himalaya are similarly unprepared for the changes already underway. A number of scientific studies point out that some of the region’s unique species, especially butterflies, have already gone extinct. Frogs and other amphibians are also at high risk.Seeing the data pile up as they compiled studies from across the Himalayas was “really shocking for us to see,” said Sunita Chaudhary, an ecosystems researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and another author of the report. Dr. Chaudhary’s team concluded that by 2100, a quarter of the plants, animals and other life-forms only found in the region could be “wiped out,” she said, adding that the Indian segment of the Himalayan mountains would be especially hard hit.While it’s too late to save some species, there’s still time to help many animals as well as the millions of humans whose lives are being radically changed by glacier loss, the researchers said. Their report includes a range of policy recommendations, including formal protections for biodiversity hot spots; encouraging collaboration among experts in separate sectors of the economy like agriculture and water; and additional research in related topics like permafrost.";Dr. Tedesco also praised the new report’s focus on the societal and ecological implications of fast-melting glaciers.The system will eventually reach a point, around approximately 2050, when the glaciers have shrunk so much that their meltwater starts to dwindle, the report said.A number of scientific studies point out that some of the region’s unique species, especially butterflies, have already gone extinct.;2023-06-20T00:01:11+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:39.849135+00:00;1923;Science;1267;The Funny Times

60493;OceanGate Was Warned of Possible ‘Catastrophic’ Problems with Titanic Mission;Experts inside and outside the company warned of potential dangers and urged the company to undergo a certification process.;"Years before OceanGate’s submersible craft went missing in the Atlantic Ocean with five people onboard, the company faced several warnings as it prepared for its hallmark mission of taking wealthy passengers to tour the Titanic’s wreckage.It was January 2018, and the company’s engineering team was about to hand over the craft — named Titan — to a new crew who would be responsible for ensuring the safety of its future passengers. But experts inside and outside the company were beginning to sound alarms.OceanGate’s director of marine operations, David Lochridge, started working on a report around that time, according to court documents, ultimately producing a scathing document in which he said the craft needed more testing and stressed “the potential dangers to passengers of the Titan as the submersible reached extreme depths.”Two months later, OceanGate faced similarly dire calls from more than three dozen people — industry leaders, deep-sea explorers and oceanographers — who warned in a letter to its chief executive, Stockton Rush, that the company’s “experimental” approach and its decision to forgo a traditional assessment could lead to potentially “catastrophic” problems with the Titanic mission.Now, as the international search for the craft enters another day, more is coming to light about the warnings leveled at OceanGate as the company raced to provide extreme tourism for the wealthy.A spokesman for OceanGate declined to comment on the five-year-old critiques from Mr. Lochridge and the industry leaders. Nor did Mr. Lochridge respond to a request for comment.Mr. Rush, the company’s chief executive, is one of the passengers on the vessel and was serving as its pilot when it went missing on Sunday, the company said on Tuesday.An aerospace engineer and pilot, he founded the company, based in Everett, Wash., in 2009. For the past three years, he has charged up to $250,000 per person for a chance to visit the wreckage of the Titanic, which sank in 1912 on its inaugural trip from England to New York.The critiques from Mr. Lochridge and the experts who signed the 2018 letter to Mr. Rush were focused in part on what they characterized as Mr. Rush’s refusal to have the Titan inspected and certified by one of the leading agencies that do such work.Mr. Lochridge reported in court records that he had urged the company to do so, but that he had been told that OceanGate was “unwilling to pay” for such an assessment. After getting Mr. Lochridge’s report, the company’s leaders held a tense meeting to discuss the situation, according to court documents filed by both sides. The documents came in a lawsuit that OceanGate filed against Mr. Lochridge in 2018, accusing him of sharing confidential information outside the company.In the documents, Mr. Lochridge reported learning that the viewport that lets passengers see outside the craft was only certified to work in depths of up to 1,300 meters.That is far less than would be necessary for trips to the Titanic, which is nearly 4,000 meters below the ocean’s surface.“The paying passengers would not be aware, and would not be informed, of this experimental design,” lawyers for Mr. Lochridge wrote in a court filing.The meeting led OceanGate to fire Mr. Lochridge, according to court documents filed by both sides. OceanGate has said in court records that he was not an engineer, that he refused to accept information from the company’s engineering team and that acoustic monitoring of the hull’s strength was better than the kind of testing that Mr. Lochridge felt was necessary.The company said in its lawsuit that it appeared Mr. Lochridge was trying to be fired. Mr. Lochridge responded by alleging wrongful termination. The legal battle ended in a settlement later in 2018.The separate warning that OceanGate received that same year came from 38 experts in the submersible craft industry; all of them were members of the Manned Underwater Vehicles committee of the Marine Technology Society, a 60-year-old industry group that promotes, studies and teaches the public about ocean technology. The experts wrote in their letter to Mr. Rush that they had “unanimous concern” about the way the Titan had been developed, and about the planned missions to the Titanic wreckage.The letter said that OceanGate’s marketing of the Titan had been “at minimum, misleading” because it claimed that the submersible would meet or exceed the safety standards of a risk assessment company known as DNV, even though the company had no plans to have the craft formally certified by the agency.“Their plan of not following classification guidelines was considered very risky,” Will Kohnen, the chairman of the committee, said in an interview on Tuesday.The industry leaders said in their letter that OceanGate should, at minimum, test its prototypes under the watch of DNV or another leading certification company.“While this may demand additional time and expense,” the signatories wrote, “it is our unanimous view that this validation process by a third-party is a critical component in the safeguards that protect all submersible occupants.”Mr. Kohnen said that Mr. Rush called him after reading the letter and told him that industry standards were stifling innovation.In an unsigned 2019 blog post titled “Why Isn’t Titan Classed?,” the company made similar arguments. OceanGate said in the post that because its Titan craft was so innovative, it could take years to get it certified by the usual assessment agencies. “Bringing an outside entity up to speed on every innovation before it is put into real-world testing is anathema to rapid innovation,” the company wrote.Another signatory of the 2018 letter, Bart Kemper, said in an interview that OceanGate had avoided having to abide by certain U.S. regulations by deploying the vessel in international waters, where Coast Guard rules did not apply.“This letter was basically asking them to please do what the other submarines do, especially the passenger ones,” said Mr. Kemper, a forensic engineer who works on submarine designs.Submersibles, unlike boats and other vessels, are largely unregulated, particularly when they operate in international waters, said Salvatore Mercogliano, an associate professor of maritime history at Campbell University in North Carolina.Because the Titan is loaded onto a Canadian ship and then dropped into the North Atlantic near the Titanic, he said, it does not need to register with a country, fly a flag or follow rules that apply to many other vessels.“It’s kind of like a boat on the back of a trailer,” Mr. Mercogliano said. “The police will ensure the trailer meets the requirements to be on the road, but they really won’t do a boat inspection.”The Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993, which regulates submersibles that carry passengers and requires that they be registered with the Coast Guard, does not apply to the Titan because it does not fly an American flag or operate in American waters, he said.Mr. Rush has spoken publicly in the past about what he viewed as regulatory red tape in the industry.“There hasn’t been an injury in the commercial sub industry in over 35 years,” he told Smithsonian magazine in a profile published in 2019. “It’s obscenely safe because they have all these regulations. But it also hasn’t innovated or grown — because they have all these regulations.”In a CBS report last year, David Pogue, a former New York Times technology columnist, joined one of OceanGate’s Titanic expeditions and said the paperwork that he signed before getting onboard warned that the Titan was an “experimental vessel” that had not been “approved or certified by any regulatory body, and could result in physical injury, emotional trauma or death.”OceanGate has made two previous expeditions to the Titanic site, in 2021 and 2022, and said in a May blog post that it “always expects new challenges” with each trip. “We’re starting our Titanic Expedition earlier than usual and have been tracking all the social media posts showing icebergs and sea ice in the area,” the post read.The earlier trips, while largely successful, were not without problems.In February, a couple in Florida sued Mr. Rush, saying that his company refused to refund them the $105,000 that they each paid to visit the Titanic on the Titan in 2018. The trip was postponed several times, according to the suit, in part because the company said it needed to run more tests on the Titan. The couple claimed that Mr. Rush reneged on his promise of giving them a refund and that the company instead demanded that they participate in a July 2021 voyage to the wreckage.The lawsuit is pending and Mr. Rush has not responded to it. Court records do not list a lawyer representing him in that case.In a court filing last year, OceanGate referenced some technical issues with the Titan during the 2021 trip.“On the first dive to the Titanic, the submersible encountered a battery issue and had to be manually attached to its lifting platform,” the company’s legal and operational adviser, David Concannon, wrote in the document, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which oversees matters having to do with the Titanic. The submersible sustained modest damage to its exterior, he wrote, leading OceanGate to cancel the mission so it could make repairs.Still, Mr. Concannon wrote in the filing, 28 people were able to visit the Titanic wreckage on the Titan last year.Mr. Concannon invited the federal judge who was hearing the case, Rebecca Beach Smith, to join the company for an expedition, according to a separate filing, something the judge seemed interested in doing.“Perhaps, if another expedition occurs in the future, I will be able to do so,” the judge wrote in May, adding that after many years of hearing cases about the Titanic wreckage, “that opportunity would be quite informative and present a first ‘eyes on’ view of the wreck site by the court.”Kitty Bennett and Susan C.

60496;Andrew Tate Indicted on Human Trafficking Charges in Romania;Prosecutors in the country announced an indictment against the antagonistic online personality known for his misogynistic remarks. He had been under house arrest outside Bucharest.;Andrew Tate, an antagonistic online personality known for his misogyny, has been indicted in Romania on charges including human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group related to the abuse of women, prosecutors there said in a statement on Tuesday.Mr. Tate, 36, a British American former kickboxer, had been living in Romania and was arrested there in December last year along with his younger brother, Tristan Tate, and two Romanian women. They were initially held in a Bucharest jail.The four have been under house arrest since April as investigations continued into the charges that were laid against them after they were arrested, which included a rape charge against one suspect as well as human trafficking and forming an organized criminal group.With the indictment, they will now face a trial in a Bucharest court, though it was unclear when that would take place.The prosecutors’ statement does not specify which of the suspects is accused of rape, but a Bucharest court of appeals document dated January, detailing the decision to prolong the pre-trial detention of the Tate brothers, appends Andrew Tate’s initials to the charge. An official in the prosecutors’ office, speaking anonymously because the details are confidential, confirmed that the elder Mr. Tate was facing the rape charge.The Tate brothers will attend a hearing on Wednesday morning, according to Mateea Petrescu, a spokeswoman for Mr. Tate and his brother.Mr. Tate, who has a vast audience of mostly young male followers on social media, has a long history of misogynistic statements, saying that women “belong” to men, and has also portrayed men as victims of false rape accusations and feminism.He has denied the accusations against him in Romania, saying he was innocent, both through his lawyer and to his nearly seven million followers on Twitter.“We embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence and vindicate their reputation,” said Ms. Petrescu, referring to the announcement of the indictment on Tuesday, calling the prosecutors’ decision “predictable.”Mr. Tate apparently chose Romania as his home and the base for his business operations because he believed he would be able to do what he liked there.“I like living in a society where my money, my influence and my power mean that I’m not below or beholden” to any laws, Mr. Tate had told his fans.But the country has in recent years made efforts to tackle the endemic corruption and lawlessness for which it had long been known.Among the charges Mr. Tate faces are accusations that he and the other suspects formed a criminal group in 2021 to commit human trafficking across Romania, the United States and Britain.Prosecutors said that the brothers had misled women into believing they wanted to establish a relationship and housed them outside Bucharest, where they were forced to perform in sex videos online.The investigators identified seven women who they said were “sexually exploited” and forced into performing sexual acts on camera by the suspects, who disseminated the content for financial gain.On two separate occasions, one of the defendants used violence and psychological pressure to rape one of the women, the prosecutors’s statement said, without specifying which defendant. On another occasion, when one of the women asked to leave the building, one of the defendants used violence against her.As part of the indictment, prosecutors have requested the confiscation of the brothers’ assets, including more than $100,000 in various currencies, cryptocurrencies valued at about $380,000, land and property in Romania and luxury cars and watches. The defendants will also have to pay the legal costs of the case, expected to be about $60,000.“I’m sure this case has absolutely nothing to do with stealing my wealth,” said Mr. Tate on Twitter on Tuesday with apparent sarcasm.Mr. Tate has told his followers that he is the victim of a conspiracy by the “matrix” — a catchall designation for what he sees as a plot by a “woke” elite and feminists to emasculate men.“The matrix sent their agents,” he told his followers on Twitter last year after the Romanian police stormed his compound.Delia Marinescu contributed reporting.;;2023-06-20T20:17:32+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:51.741353+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60497;Palestinian Gunmen Kill 4 Israeli Civilians in Occupied West Bank;Two Hamas members carried out the attack outside Eli, a settlement in the northern West Bank, before being shot dead themselves.;Two Palestinian gunmen shot and killed four Israeli civilians on Tuesday afternoon outside a Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest attack on Israelis since January.The shootings occurred at a restaurant and gas station next to the settlement of Eli, about 25 miles north of Jerusalem, video showed. An Israeli civilian shot and killed one of the assailants, a Palestinian from a nearby Arab town, and a second attacker was later shot in his getaway vehicle after a manhunt, security officials said.Hamas, the Islamist militia and political movement that controls the Gaza Strip, said that the attackers had been members of its armed wing and described the violence as a response to recent Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, police raids on a mosque in Jerusalem and military incursions in the northern West Bank.Hamas has often avoided direct acknowledgment recently of any involvement in West Bank violence. Its decision to claim responsibility this time raised the possibility of Israeli reprisals on Hamas leaders and infrastructure in both Gaza and the West Bank.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement: “Our forces are now working on the ground in order to settle accounts with the murderers. In recent months, we have already proven that we do settle accounts with all of the murderers, without exception. Those who have attacked us are either in the grave or in prison, and so it will be here.”The attack also renewed calls from within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition — the most nationalist and socially conservative in Israeli history — for even more forceful action in the territory.Israeli forces already conduct daily raids within Palestinian towns in the West Bank, in what experts say is the most sustained military operation there since the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the 2000s. One such raid on Monday prompted an unusually prolonged gun battle between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants in another part of the northern West Bank, killing six Palestinians and causing rare damage to Israeli military vehicles.That brought the death toll for Palestinians this year to more than 160. Most of them were killed in the West Bank during Israeli military raids — one of the highest death rates in the last decade and a half.But some right-wing lawmakers in Israel say the army needs to do even more to counter a wave of Arab violence that has killed at least 29 Israelis in 2023, most of them during attacks by Palestinians.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. It has occupied the territory ever since, constructing hundreds of Jewish settlements that most countries say are illegal under international law but that settlers consider a legitimate reclamation of land that was ruled by Jews in antiquity.The vanishing likelihood of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, the entrenchment of Israel’s control on territory and a weakening of the mainstream Palestinian leadership there have all contributed to a rise in Palestinian militancy. Much of it is driven by a new generation of small armed groups frustrated with the status quo.The Israeli government announced this past week that it would make it faster and easier to approve settlement construction in the West Bank, and is expected to advance plans next week for more than 4,000 new housing units in settlements in the territory.The shooting on Tuesday happened on the main highway in the West Bank, around a gas station mainly used by Israeli settlers but easily accessible to Palestinians. The site was previously attacked in 2015.The Israeli military said in a statement that the gunmen first shot three civilians at a restaurant near the entrance to Eli, before killing another person at the nearby gas station and injuring several others. One of the attackers was then shot by a passer-by, and the second drove roughly 25 miles north before being intercepted and shot by a group of Israeli security officers.Eli was established in 1984 on hundreds of acres of land that was claimed by nearby Palestinian villages but that Israeli officials said had no private owners. It is now home to roughly 4,600 Israelis, and houses an academy that prepares religious Israelis for military service and whose founders are known for their ultraconservative views.Hiba Yazbek contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City.;In recent months, we have already proven that we do settle accounts with all of the murderers, without exception.;2023-06-20T21:34:02+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:52.276631+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60498;Site Where Julius Caesar Was Killed Is Opened For Tourism;The site where Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators in 44 B.C., nestled among four ancient temples, has been opened to the public for the first time in a century.;"For nearly a century, only cats (and presumably the rats they kept at bay) had free rein over an ancient archaeological site in the heart of central Rome. They would prowl among the ruins and preen for the tourists who gathered along the balustrades above, cellphones and cameras in hand.But as of Tuesday, human visitors were allowed for the first time to descend and get a better glimpse of the site, believed to be where Julius Caesar was brutally assassinated by a group of senators in 44 B.C. The spot is nestled in an area with four temples, rare remnants of the Roman Republic, dating from the fourth to the first centuries B.C.The full site, called the Sacred Area of Largo di Torre Argentina, is the latest addition to Rome’s rich archaeological offerings. The Italian capital’s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, said at the inauguration on Monday that the attraction would add “tremendous value to a city that never ceases to amaze with its treasures and wonders.” Rome was discovering “its history to the fullest,” he added.There is no X-marks-the-spot where Julius Caesar met his bloody end on — as tradition and the Shakespeare play “Julius Caesar” would have it — the Ides of March, about the 15th day of the month. The spot contains just a jumble of limestone rocks, bricks and tufts of grass.That might surprise some, said the archaeologist Monica Ceci, who oversees the site.Visitors “may have a hard time imagining this, because the Shakespearean drama induces you to think that the murder was in the forum,” she said.Caesar was actually assassinated at the Curia of Pompey, a large rectangular meeting hall where the Senate of Rome met occasionally. The emperor Augustus later declared the hall a “locus sceleratus,” or “cursed place,” and it was walled up.But Shakespeare “could get away with” a little artistic license, Ms. Ceci laughed.On the opposite side of the site, marble decorations and sculptures, for decades stored unseen in Rome’s archaeological warehouses, have been displayed in a long hall under the modern-day street. “It’s one thing to keep them in order on shelves, quite another to tell the history of this site through these fragments,” Ms. Ceci said.Irina Lumsden, a data engineer visiting Rome from Melbourne, Australia, said that the site was transporting. “It’s amazing, you get such a feeling of ancient time here,” she said “They’ve done a great job of conserving the site.”The area was rediscovered during excavations from 1926 to 1929, when the square was being demolished to make way for new buildings. The four temples unearthed were initially labeled with the first four letters of the alphabet because archaeologists were unsure which temples they had uncovered. Now they have been tentatively identified, though there is still scholarly debate: the Temple of Juturna, after a goddess of fountains, wells and springs, dating from the mid-third century B.C.; the Temple of Fortuna Huiusce Diei, or Fortune of the Present Day, built in the second century B.C.; the Temple of Feronia, a goddess of fertility, built about the end of the fourth century B.C.; and the Temple of Lares Permarini, dedicated to the protectors of navigation, or according to others to the Nymphs, and constructed in the early second century B.C.The Curia of Pompey was erected a little later, in the first century B.C.After a fire devastated this part of Rome in A.D. 80, the emperor Domitian restored the temples and a travertine slab floor, still visible, was built on top of the surrounding rubble.Over the centuries, the area underwent various further transformations, remaining buried until the excavations in the 1920s. City officials at the time immediately understood the value of the archaeological find, and the site was closed off, to be admired only from above.Monica Baraschi, a volunteer with a cat sanctuary that abuts one corner of the ancient site, said that even the feline residents — there were 86, she said — would feel some benefits from the opening up of the spot and the arrival of visitors.“They’ll get cuddled and caressed — the cats will be happy,” she said.In the past, there has been friction between archaeologists and the sanctuary. Ms. Ceci, the archaeologist, said that the cats had been “good workmates” during the two years that the site was undergoing work to prepare for the opening.Visitors on the first day also seemed glad to see a bit of ancient Rome up close. Simeon Peebler, a software engineer from Chicago, said, “In a world of virtual-reality experiences, to have a real reality experience is amazing.”Romans were equally delighted. Sandro Lubattelli, a retired computer engineer and his wife, Rossana Cipressi, a retired teacher, said that they had spent a lifetime looking at the site from above and were thrilled to finally be able to go in.“We always wondered why it was closed,” Mr. Lubattelli said. “We’re in seventh heaven.”";For nearly a century, only cats (and presumably the rats they kept at bay) had free rein over an ancient archaeological site in the heart of central Rome.The four temples unearthed were initially labeled with the first four letters of the alphabet because archaeologists were unsure which temples they had uncovered.Simeon Peebler, a software engineer from Chicago, said, “In a world of virtual-reality experiences, to have a real reality experience is amazing.”Romans were equally delighted.;2023-06-20T16:21:22+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:52.857960+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60499;German Spy Agency Says China and Russia Are After Its Secrets;The country is a growing target for foreign espionage, the agency said, amid rising tensions over the war in Ukraine and rivalries between Washington and Beijing.;Foreign intelligence services are increasingly targeting Germany, its domestic intelligence agency said on Tuesday, warning that espionage, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, particularly from China and Russia, “pose a serious threat” to the country.Though such assessments are issued annually, this year’s report was exceptional both for the strength of the warnings and as a measure of just how much Germany’s security environment had changed in a year.Earlier this month, the government issued a comprehensive national security strategy for the first time, part of an expanding effort to confront Germany’s vulnerability to new military, economic and geopolitical threats.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising global tensions with China served as a backdrop to the country’s increased exposure to foreign interference, given its position both in NATO and as one of the most powerful countries in the European Union, the agency said.“Russia’s war against Ukraine also means a turning point for internal security,” Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said at the news conference presenting the report from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, as the agency is known.Yet the report’s strongest warning was reserved for China, which the agency described as “the greatest threat in terms of economic and scientific espionage.”The publication of the harsh assessment of Chinese intelligence activities came at an awkward moment for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who on the same day was hosting the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, as part of the annual Germany-China government consultations.The talks — meant to renew relations between the two nations after a three-year hiatus from in-person talks during the pandemic — come in a changed world of increasing geopolitical tensions with China over its relationship with Russia, and growing efforts by Washington and other Western governments to “de-risk” economic ties with Beijing.The report notied that Germany in 2022 was one of China’s most important targets in Europe for legal investment.“Direct investments not only offer China the opportunity to make up for innovation deficits and achieve a technological lead, but also open the door to political influence, espionage and sabotage,” the report said, warning that it could also pose risks for national security.“The extent of these activities can also jeopardize Germany’s competitiveness as an industrial and technology location and undermine the laws of the market economy,” the report added. “Ultimately, this threatens to result in a loss of prosperity and, as a consequence, risks to democracy, social cohesion and Germany’s independence.”The Chinese delegation, which is also meeting with German business leaders, is expected to try to persuade the government not to impose stricter restrictions on Chinese companies operating in the country.The Chinese delegation was also likely to push against restrictions on the telecommunications firm Huawei expanding its 5G network in Germany, as the government is widely expected to do under recent laws that limit foreign investments in critical infrastructure.Germany’s political establishment remains deeply divided over the government’s decision to allow the Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to purchase a minority stake in a terminal at the Hamburg port. Intelligence services and several ministries had advised against it.But in two other recent cases, the government blocked Chinese purchases of two German companies involved in the semiconductor industry.Three other countries named by the agency for increased intelligence operations were Iran, Turkey and North Korea, although much of that seemed focused on their domestic rivals based in Germany.Thomas Haldenwang, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, said that Germany and Europe had successfully intensified efforts to expel members of Russia’s diplomatic corps suspected of being intelligence agents — Germany deported 40 suspected clandestine agents from the Russian embassy last year, while overall in Europe some 400 were expelled.More had been expelled in 2023, he noted, saying those efforts have limited Russia’s espionage capacity.Russia is likely to “act more clandestinely and aggressively in the future,” Mr. Haldenwang said. “This could include the use of so-called illegals— intelligence officers smuggled in with false identities — as well as increased cyberattacks and even sabotage operations.”Several “illegals” have been exposed across Europe since the war in Ukraine began, though no major cases have been found in Germany so far. However, last year, Germany discovered a Russian mole in its own foreign intelligence services.Ms. Faeser, the interior minister, said cybersecurity was “an even more acute risk for Germany.”She added that Russia would focus on “hybrid attacks,” including disinformation campaigns that encouraged conspiracy theories and support for far-right groups.The agency has for several years described the far-right as the biggest threat to German democracy, including the Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD. The agency estimated that some 10,000 of the party’s 28,500 members were suspected extremists.Even so, the party has been on the rise, reaching 20 percent in some national polls.The rise of conspiracy theories in the wake of the pandemic has added to the potency of the far-right threat, according to analysts.Last year, security raids foiled a planned coup attempt by a group of right-wing conspiracy theorists — among them AfD members — who had concocted a fantastical plot to instate a prince as the country’s leader.The plot had no known links to Russia but shows the reason for authorities’ concern. The conspirators were unlikely a serious threat to Germany’s government, but they were collecting weapons and planned to attack the Parliament.At the news conference, Mr. Haldenwang was asked to describe the difference in his assessment of the intelligence risks from Russia and China.He declined to say directly which country was a greater threat, but said: “The Russian services’ approach is more robust, more visible. They work in a classical way, actually with all means known to the espionage sector. Sometimes even with means one knows only from films. Russian services do not restrain themselves in extreme consequence — also from the killing of persons.”“This very robust way of doing something like that, we don’t see that with the Chinese,” he said.;However, last year, Germany discovered a Russian mole in its own foreign intelligence services.Ms.They work in a classical way, actually with all means known to the espionage sector.Sometimes even with means one knows only from films.;2023-06-20T17:24:49+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:53.348001+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60500;Germany’s Far Right AfD Party Stages a Comeback;With Germans facing an era of political and economic turbulence, the Alternative for Germany is resurgent. Mainstream politicians are struggling to respond.;The tables were packed at the Waldhaus, a restaurant on the wooded outskirts of an east German town, as the regulars — workers shaking calloused hands, retirees clutching purses in their lap — settled in for a pub gathering of the far-right Alternative for Germany.But the die-hards worry Germany’s political leadership less than people like Ina Radzheit. An insurance agent in a flowered blouse, she squeezed in among platters of schnitzel and frothy beers for her first visit to the AfD, the German initials by which the party is known.“What’s wrong?” she said. “Where do I start?” She feels unsafe with migration rising. She is uncomfortable with Germany providing weapons to Ukraine. She is exasperated by government squabbling over climate plans she fears will cost citizens like her their modest but comfortable way of life.“I can’t say now if I would ever vote for the AfD,” she said. “But I am listening.”As anxieties over Germany’s future rise, so too, it seems, does the AfD.The AfD has reached a polling high in Germany’s formerly Communist eastern states, where it is now the leading party, drawing around a third of voters. It is edging up in the wealthier west. Nationally, it is polling neck and neck with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats.If the trend lasts, the AfD could present its most serious threat to Germany’s political establishment since 2017, when it became the first far-right party to enter Parliament since World War II.The turnabout is surprising for a party whose political obituaries filled the German media a year ago, after it had sunk in national elections. And it reflects the unease of a country at a crossroads.After decades of postwar prosperity, Germany is struggling to transform its 20th-century industrial exporting model into a digitized economy that can withstand climate change and competition from powers like China.“We are living in a world of global upheaval,” said Rene Springer, the national AfD lawmaker speaking at the Waldhaus in Gera. “Our responsibility to our children is to one day leave them better off than we are. That’s no longer to be expected.”When it was elected in 2021, Mr. Scholz’s three-party coalition vowed to lead Germany through a painful but necessary transformation. Instead, the country was plunged into deeper uncertainty by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.At first, the coalition seemed to beat the odds: Allies praised its pledge to overwrite postwar pacifism with military revitalization. It found alternatives to cheap Russian gas — nearly 50 percent of its supply — with unexpected speed.But then the country dipped into recession. Migration numbers reached all-time highs, mostly driven by Ukrainian refugees. And the coalition began fighting among itself over how to return to the course it set for Germany before the war.The AfD, a party that mostly drew support by criticizing migration, found new appeal as defender of Germany’s economically precarious class.“With migration, the AfD offered a cultural narrative and identity to those anxious about their future,” said Johannes Hillje, a German political scientist who studies the AfD. “Now, the cultural threat is coming not just from the outside, but within — that is, the transformation policy of the government.”The AfD has resurged despite domestic intelligence classifying it a “suspected” right-wing extremist organization, allowing it to be put under surveillance. Its branch in Thuringia, where the Waldhaus gathering was held, is classified as “confirmed” extremist.A month earlier, its national youth wing was also classified confirmed extremist, though that label was recently lifted as a case regarding its status is settled in the courts.In April, the domestic intelligence agency head, Thomas Haldenwang, said in the agency’s yearly report that of 28,500 AfD members, around 10,000 are believed to be extremists.Yet a full third of Germans now view it as a “normal democratic party,” Mr. Hillje said. “The paradox is that, at the same time, it has become more and more clear that this is really a radical party, if not an extremist party.”In previous years, the party seemed ready to sideline extreme figures. No longer. This April, co-leader Alice Weidel spoke alongside Björn Höcke, party leader in Thuringia and seen as one of the AfD’s most radical politicians.Mr. Höcke was recently charged by state prosecutors for using the phrase “everything for Germany” at a rally — a Nazi Storm Trooper slogan.None of that dampened the enthusiasm at the Waldhaus in Gera, a town of about 93,000 in eastern Thuringia, where the AfD is the most popular party.Anke Wettengel, a schoolteacher, called such labels the equivalent of focusing on hooligan fans of a soccer team — not a reflection of normal supporters, like her.Nor did she see a problem with Mr. Höcke’s language.“That was a very normal sentence,” she said. “We should be allowed to be proud of our country today without immediately being accused of being extremists.”From the stage, Mr. Springer railed against not only immigrant labor reforms, calling them a “traitorous system against native citizens,” but also criticized new climate measures.The audience thumped their tables in approval.Stefan Brandner, Gera’s AfD representative, shared statistics that he said overwhelmingly linked foreigners to murders and food handouts, eliciting gasps from the crowd.Many guests said it is such “real facts” that drew them to AfD events. (The federal government wrote in a document providing statistics to the AfD that the data was not substantial enough for such conclusions.)Political analysts say Germany’s main parties share the blame for the AfD’s rise. Mr. Scholz’s coalition failed to convincingly communicate its transformation plans — and instead appeared locked in internal battles over how to carry them out.Their mainstream conservative opponents, including the Christian Democrats of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, are edging closer to AfD positions, hoping to regain voters themselves.They are adopting the AfD’s antagonism to gender-neutral language, as well as tougher stances on migration. Some Christian Democratic leaders are even calling to remove asylum rights in Germany’s constitution.AfD supporters have noticed their views becoming normalized even as rivals try to marginalize the party — and that makes it more difficult for mainstream parties to regain their trust.“They are getting hardened,” said Julia Reuschenbach, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin. “No group of core voters is as unreachable as those of the AfD.”Last week, the German Institute for Human Rights, a state-funded organization, released a study arguing that the language and tactics used by the AfD “to achieve its racist and right-wing extremist goals” could meet conditions for banning the party as a “danger to the free democratic order.”Yet such proposals create another dilemma for democratic society: The tools Germany has for fighting the party it sees as a threat are the same that reinforce sentiments among AfD supporters that their country is not actually democratic.“How can it be that an organization funded by the state can stand up and try to stigmatize a significant part of its voters?” Mr. Springer asked in an interview.It is a question to which those in the crowd, like Ms. Wettengel, have found unsettling answers.“Mainstream politics are against the people,” she said. “Not for the people.”The real test of AfD support won’t come until next year, when several east German states hold elections and it has a chance at taking the largest share of the vote.In the meantime, every week, AfD politicians fan out across the country, hosting information booths, pub nights and citizen dialogues, as if it already were campaign season.Outside the train station of Hennigsdorf, a Berlin suburb, the state AfD lawmaker Andreas Galau handed out pamphlets to visitors with an unwavering smile. Some passers-by shouted insults. Others were curious.“Many come here just to get their frustrations off their chest,” he said with a chuckle. “They come and tell us what is on their minds — we’re a bit of a therapy group.”More and more people, he said, no longer feel ashamed to show interest in the AfD. It is this sense that the political establishment is not listening to ordinary people that may be helping fill out the AfD’s ranks.In Gera, Mr. Springer’s address to the crowd seemed an exercise in catharsis and validation.“They think we are stupid,” he said. “They’ll think again when the next elections come.”;This April, co-leader Alice Weidel spoke alongside Björn Höcke, party leader in Thuringia and seen as one of the AfD’s most radical politicians.Mr.(The federal government wrote in a document providing statistics to the AfD that the data was not substantial enough for such conclusions.)Political analysts say Germany’s main parties share the blame for the AfD’s rise.;2023-06-20T13:36:24+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:53.969656+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60501;French Police Search Paris Olympics Offices in Corruption Investigation;French prosecutors said they were investigating potential conflicts of interest, embezzlement and favoritism connected to public contracts signed by organizers of the Games.;The French police searched the headquarters of the Paris 2024 Olympics organizing committee and other offices on Tuesday as part of two corruption investigations over contracts signed in connection with the Games, prosecutors said.While the scope and nature of the investigations were not fully clear on Tuesday, the investigations threatened to tarnish an image of integrity and transparency that the authorities overseeing the Paris 2024 plans had sought to project, after a string of past Olympic bids that were riddled by corruption allegations.The offices of the Paris 2024 organizing committee, in Seine-Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris, and those of a separate body in charge of Games-related infrastructure, in western Paris, were both searched by investigators, according to the National Financial Prosecutor’s office.The prosecutor’s office, which handles high-level financial crimes and offenses, said that the searches were being carried out as part of two separate investigations, both inquiries into potential conflicts of interest, embezzlement and favoritism.The first, opened in 2017, is related to procurement contracts signed by the Paris 2024 Olympics organizing committee, which is in charge of planning, organizing and financing the Games, in coordination with Paris City Hall, the International Olympic Committee, and the French sports authorities.The second was opened in 2022 after an inspection that was carried out by the French Anticorruption Agency, an official government watchdog. It relates to procurement contracts signed by the organizing committee and by SOLIDEO, a body overseeing permanent Games-related construction that is currently supervising 58 Olympic and Paralympic projects, according to the company’s website.The National Financial Prosecutor’s office did not provide further details on the nature of the contracts.In 2021, the news agency Agence France-Presse reported that a confidential report by the French Anticorruption Agency on the organization of the 2024 games in Paris had warned of the “risks of impropriety” and “conflicts of interest” in the process.Representatives for the organizing committee and for SOLIDEO confirmed the searches but did not provide details, saying only that they were “fully cooperating” with investigators.A spokesperson for the organizing committee said that it had “stringent procedures” in place “to ensure the transparency and propriety of the several hundred contracts it has awarded.”Multiple audits by the French Anticorruption Agency and by the Cour des Comptes, France’s national auditing agency, “have not raised the slightest wrongdoing,” the spokesperson added.The Olympic Games will run from July 26 to Aug. 11 next year, and the Paralympic Games from Aug. 28 to Sept. 6. The games are expected to draw over 10,000 athletes and millions of spectators, in a very different atmosphere from the last ones, which were held in Tokyo in 2021 under strict Covid related protocols.In January, the Cour des Comptes, estimated that the Games would cost nearly 9 billion euros, or $9.8 billion, up from an initial assessment of 6.9 billion euros in the bidding phase.Judicial investigations can take years in France, and it was not yet clear whether the two inquiries disclosed on Tuesday would end with charges.But Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris 2024 Olympic organizing committee, had stressed that he wanted the organization’s conduct to be spotless.“There is a shared determination to make these Games an exemplary project from every point of view: in terms of budgetary rigor, transparency and the environment,” he told Le Parisien in 2017, the year Paris won its bid to host the Games.Organizers of Olympic Games in other countries have faced similar investigations in the past, repeatedly casting doubts on the integrity of the process.In February, Japanese prosecutors accused Dentsu, a Japanese advertising giant, and other companies of conspiring to evade the public bidding process leading up to the Games, as part of a broad investigation into corruption surrounding the Tokyo Olympics.In 2021, Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the former longtime head of Brazil’s Olympic committee, was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison after a judge in Brazil ruled that Rio de Janeiro’s success at securing the 2016 Summer Games was built on a bribery scheme. The decision came four years after he was detained as part of a joint investigation into sports corruption by investigators in Brazil and France.And in the late 1990s, a bribery scandal erupted around the process in which Salt Lake City won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games, with a senior Olympic official acknowledging widespread corruption and two chief organizers indicted on charges that included conspiracy to commit bribery. Those organizers were ultimately acquitted by a federal judge, but the five-year scandal tainted the Games.;Those organizers were ultimately acquitted by a federal judge, but the five-year scandal tainted the Games.;2023-06-20T18:25:18+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:54.693850+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60502;Waiting for the Justices;We’re covering the coming affirmative action ruling, the search for a submersible and Hunter Biden.;"Sometime in the next 10 days, the Supreme Court is expected to tightly restrict or ban race-based affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling could come as soon as tomorrow or as late as Friday, June 30, before the justices leave for their summer break.In today’s newsletter, I will walk through two of the big uncertainties about the decision — one involving the ruling itself, the other involving the political reaction. With both questions, the dynamics are quite different from what they were with the highest-profile case last year, on abortion.In the abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the details of the court’s ruling were of only secondary importance. The justices faced a fundamental decision: Should they overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to outlaw abortion? Once a majority of justices decided to do so, the written opinions that they released were less meaningful.“The decision in Dobbs was essentially binary,” Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for The Times, told me. “The affirmative action rulings are likely to be more complicated, raising more questions than they resolve.”Many experts expect the court to strike down the two specific race-based admissions programs that they’re reviewing, at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. But the detailed rationale will matter. It will shape future admissions policies, as well as any legal challenges to those policies from opponents of affirmative action.One question is whether the justices will allow university administrators to monitor the racial composition of the student body, even if they cannot use race-based admissions preferences. In a 2007 case about K-12 education, Justice Anthony Kennedy (who has since retired) made this subtle distinction. He held that schools could use racially neutral factors to achieve racial diversity.What does that mean? Imagine that a college gave an admissions bonus to children of all races who grew up in a neighborhood with a poverty rate of at least 15 percent. Under Kennedy’s standard, the college could still analyze how many Black students were enrolling — and change the threshold to, say, 20 percent partly to increase Black enrollment.The current court may reject Kennedy’s distinction, however. It might rule that racial diversity is not a legitimate factor for colleges to prioritize and might bar almost any discussion of race.Either way, the ruling is unlikely to be the last word. The admissions process is too complex for the justices to anticipate every scenario. The ruling will instead become the ground rules on which future legal cases are fought.Barring a major surprise from the court, the ruling will probably anger many Democrats. They may also be tempted to assume that a political backlash will follow, as happened after the Dobbs ruling.In that case, the court was indeed acting in defiance of public opinion. Polls show that most Americans support widespread access to abortion, at least early in pregnancy. After the court overturned Roe and abortion became less available, some voters evidently reacted by voting for Democrats in last year’s midterm elections.“But,” as my colleagues Michael Powell and Ilana Marcus recently wrote, “the politics of affirmative action are different.”Most Americans oppose race-based admissions programs, polls show. When these programs have appeared on the ballot, they have almost always lost, including in Arizona, California, Michigan and Washington State, which are hardly red states. In California three years ago, the policy lost in heavily white and Asian communities — and fared worse in Black and Hispanic areas than Democratic candidates did.Votes in Los Angeles County precints by predominant race or ethnicitySupport forProposition 16Support forBidenAsian39%64%White4769Hispanic5578Black789325%50%75%100%Support for Proposition 16Support for BidenAsian39%64%White4769Hispanic5578Black789325%50%75%100%Note: Chart shows Biden’s two-party vote share.California Statewide Database; L2; Harvard University ALARM ProjectBy Eli MurrayIf Democrats try to generate mass outrage about a court ruling on affirmative action, they are likely to be disappointed, as Carlos E. Cortés, a historian at the University of California, Riverside, and a supporter of the policy himself, recently told The Times. “If they keep making it a cause, they will just alienate Hispanic and Asian voters,” Cortés said.Yet Democrats may have a more promising path open to them. Polls also show that most Americans do support giving students credit for overcoming economic disadvantage. And economic disadvantage is not evenly distributed across racial groups.Policies that consider family wealth and neighborhood wealth — rather than only income, the poverty rate and parental education — are especially likely to produce diverse classes. They’re also likely to remain legal, whatever the justices say about race. If liberals make a major push to expand those policies, it could have a big effect.“On one level, a Supreme Court decision ending racial preferences presents a crisis,” Richard Kahlenberg recently wrote for The Liberal Patriot. “Simply ending racial programs without coming up with something new would devastate Black and Hispanic constituencies and be terrible for the country. But Democrats also will have been handed an opportunity to create something better — an affirmative action policy that reminds working people of what they have in common, not what divides them.”And a tip: Even more so than with other big Supreme Court cases, I encourage you to read beyond the headlines and into the details of the coverage. And remember that journalists don’t get advance copies of Supreme Court rulings, which typically appear around 10 a.m. Eastern. We need to spend the morning making sense of them. As a result, coverage of a complex decision tends to be strongest starting in the afternoon.Related: Students whose lives were shaped by race-conscious admissions share their thoughts.Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his taxes on time.

60504;41 Dead After Riot Erupts in Honduran Women’s Prison;The inmates were found shot or burned to death in the latest spasm of violence in the country’s troubled prison system.;At least 41 inmates were killed on Tuesday morning in central Honduras after a riot broke out at the country’s only prison for women, one of the deadliest outbreaks of violence in the country’s long-troubled prison system.Most of the victims had been burned, while others had been shot, said Yuri Mora, a spokesman for the public prosecutor’s office, who added that the death toll was expected to rise as investigators combed through the detention facility in Támara, near Tegucigalpa, the capital.While the cause of the violence was not clear, the prison has been the scene of ongoing conflict between feuding gangs.“We are dismayed by the loss of human lives,” Julissa Villanueva, vice minister of security and head of the Honduran penitentiary system, said in a news conference. The country’s penal system, she said, had been “hijacked” by organized crime.The death toll on Tuesday makes the episode the deadliest prison riot in the Central American country in years. In late 2019, nearly 40 gang members were killed in clashes at two all-male prisons over the same weekend.Killings have surged in recent years in the women’s prison, where several inmates have been strangled or stabbed during confrontations between female gang members of two rival criminal organizations: the 18th Street gang and the MS-13 gang.The country’s president, Xiomara Castro, said she was “shocked” by the deaths and promised to take “drastic measures” to hold responsible officials accountable.The riot was “planned by gangs in full view of the law enforcement authorities,” she tweeted, without elaborating.The MS-13 and 18th Street gangs, longtime rivals that originated in the United States, have fomented violence in Honduras and neighboring countries for decades.Struggling to contain them, Ms. Castro has declared and extended states of emergency since December, suspending some constitutional rights and allowing security agents to detain people who they believe might be associated with gangs.The model is similar to a far more aggressive approach in El Salvador, where a government crackdown on gang violence has caused homicide rates to plummet — though civil rights groups say it has led to mass arbitrary arrests, extreme overcrowding in prisons and torture.Honduras’s strategy to tackle gangs has led to a drop in violence this year, the national police has said, though not as steep as in El Salvador.And extortion by gangs, “one of the main causes of insecurity, migration, displacement, loss of freedom,” according to Ms. Castro, remains a significant problem. A recent report by the local chapter of Transparency International concluded that 8.4 percent of Honduran households continue to suffer from extortion, only a slight drop from last year’s 9 percent.Violence is not uncommon in prisons in Honduras and other Central American countries where overcrowded facilities filled with rival gang members provide fertile ground for unrest.A 2021 report on Honduras by Human Rights Watch said that “Overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, poor sanitation, beatings, intra-gang violence, and detainee killings are endemic in prisons.”Honduras’s National Women’s Penitentiary for Social Adaptation housed about 800 inmates, roughly double its capacity, according to a government official.The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in 2020, recorded “several violent events” across Honduran prisons, including the women’s facility, “where no violent deaths had been reported before.” Some of those incidents “were allegedly perpetrated with firearms and other prohibited objects,” the commission said.Contraband, including alcohol, drugs, pistols, machine guns and even grenades, have been found inside prisons, according to Honduran authorities. Local news outlets have reported that some inmates bribe officials to be able to smuggle weapons into the prisons.The Honduran government in April unveiled a plan to address corruption within the prison system and try to tamp down the violence, including ensuring that inmates are not armed and isolating those with links to criminal gangs and organized crime.The deadly riot on Tuesday was “the product of a direct attack by organized crime against the actions that we are deliberately taking,” Ms. Villanueva told reporters, referring to Ms. Castro’s anti-gang push.;;2023-06-20T22:45:46+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:56.489039+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60505;Russia Sends Attack Drones Across Ukraine, Targeting Kyiv and Lviv;Moscow’s forces also shot and killed a rescue worker in the flood-stricken city of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said, as both sides battled for territory in the south and east.;"Russia unleashed dozens of attack drones across Ukraine before dawn on Tuesday, targeting the cities of Kyiv and Lviv, far from the front lines where Ukraine’s counteroffensive made small gains and Russian forces tried to seize more territory in eastern Ukraine.Moscow’s military also fired on rescue workers in the flood-stricken city of Kherson on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said, killing one person and injuring eight others while they were responding to the catastrophic effects of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam this month.The Interior Ministry of Ukraine said in a statement that unarmed State Emergency Service workers in Kherson had come under “heavy shelling.” Calling the workers heroes, it said that “killing rescuers” during one of the country’s largest man-made disasters was “a manifestation of fear.”The drone attack on Kyiv, the capital, was the first in more than two weeks. Russian forces repeatedly targeted the city throughout May, but recently there had been a relative lull — with the notable exception of missile barrage fired at Kyiv last week while a delegation of African leaders visited to discuss a path to peace talks.Air-raid alerts sounded in Kyiv shortly before 3 a.m. local time on Tuesday and the authorities warned civilians to take shelter. The alerts lasted for more than three hours as the drones came in waves and from various directions, said Serhiy Popko, the head of the city’s military administration.“Another massive air attack on the capital,” he posted on the Telegram messaging app.Ukraine’s Air Force said Russian forces had launched 35 Iranian-made drones at targets, with the region around Kyiv “the main area of attack.” Air defenses had shot down 32 of the drones, it said, including more than two dozen near the capital.The Air Force did not elaborate on what or where the three remaining drones hit, but the air defenses in and around Kyiv are much more robust than those protecting the rest of the country.Lviv, in western Ukraine near the Polish border, had long been considered a relative haven from attacks occurring closer to Russian-held territory. But the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, reported explosions in and near the city around 5 a.m. and urged residents to seek shelter. The authorities said that critical infrastructure had been struck, sparking a fire, but did not elaborate. There were no injuries, according to the regional military administrator.The shelling that killed the emergency worker was part of dozens of Russian strikes on the southern Kherson region over the previous day. A total of 57 strikes — from mortars, artillery, tanks and rockets — hit the region on Monday, the regional military administration said in a statement, adding that an ambulance crew had also come under fire and five people had been injured.The bombardment of Kherson, which Russian soldiers occupied for several months last year, has not let up since an explosion two weeks ago destroyed the Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, sending torrents of floodwaters into residential areas.Emergency workers have struggled under artillery fire to evacuate thousands of people from submerged homes. And the fighting in the region has created hurdles to delivering help, aid workers say.Even as the waters have receded, the consequences of the disaster have spread. Pollutants and pathogens moving downstream on the Dnipro and into the Black Sea have prompted the Ukrainian health authorities to warn about waterborne disease.Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Telegram that the Russian Army had fired at recovery workers clearing silt.The attacks came as Ukrainian forces were making marginal gains in a counteroffensive in the southern and eastern part of the country. On Monday, Ukraine said troops had recaptured eight settlements in two weeks of fighting.Ukrainian officials and military experts warned on Tuesday of a long fight ahead.“In some areas our warriors are moving forward; in some areas they are defending their positions and resisting the occupiers’ assaults and intensified attacks,” Mr. Zelensky said in an overnight speech. He added that he was confident that Ukraine’s forces would prevail.Even as Russian forces were trying to fend off Kyiv’s offensive, Moscow launched “offensive actions” in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions as part of a broader campaign to take more land in a part of Ukraine where it has held substantial territory since 2014, Ukraine’s general staff said in a daily update on Tuesday.Moscow was trying to advance near Lyman, Bakhmut, Marinka and Avdiivka in the Donetsk region — according to Hanna Malyar, a Ukrainian deputy defense minister. Lyman fell to Russian forces last spring but was retaken by Ukraine in October.“Despite the fact that the offensive of our armed forces continues in several directions in the south, the Russians also have their own directions of attack, and they are also going on the offensive,” Ms. Malyar said on national television.The Russian military released a statement saying it had destroyed Ukrainian troop units and equipment in several locations, and repelled Ukrainian assaults — claims that could not be verified.Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Tuesday that the counteroffensive would be much slower than the rapid gains seen in September, when Ukrainian forces took back a large section of the northeastern region of Kharkiv in a matter of weeks.Russia, which had months to prepare the terrain it is now defending, built an extensive network of minefields, tank obstacles, trenches and bunkers.Cassandra Vinograd reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Victoria Kim from Seoul. Matthew Mpoke Bigg contributed reporting from London, and Megan Specia and Oleksandr Chubko from Kyiv.";But the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, reported explosions in and near the city around 5 a.m. and urged residents to seek shelter.The authorities said that critical infrastructure had been struck, sparking a fire, but did not elaborate.And the fighting in the region has created hurdles to delivering help, aid workers say.Even as the waters have receded, the consequences of the disaster have spread.;2023-06-20T22:28:09+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:56.971199+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60506;Your Wednesday Briefing: The Search for the Missing Titanic Sub;Also, a shake-up at Alibaba and a taste of Singapore’s street food.;"An international team of rescuers was racing against time to find a deep-diving submersible with five people on board after it lost contact in the North Atlantic during a tour to explore the wreck of the Titanic.The submersible, the Titan, is thought to be equipped with less than two days’ worth of oxygen, and as of 1 p.m. Eastern time yesterday, there was probably about 40 hours of breathable air left, the U.S. Coast Guard said.Contact with the Titan was lost on Sunday more than halfway into what should have been a two-and-a-half-hour dive. The five people on board are Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer; Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani businessman and explorer, and his son, Suleman; and Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French maritime expert who has been on over 35 dives to the Titanic wreck site. Stockton Rush, the chief executive of OceanGate Expeditions, was piloting the submersible, according to the company.The search for the Titan faces a series of obstacles, and even if it can be found, retrieving it will not be easy. The search area lies more than two miles below the surface, with pressure equal to being beneath a 100-story tower of solid lead.Dangerous tourism: OceanGate Expeditions has provided tours of the Titanic wreck since 2021 for a price of up to $250,000 per person, as part of a booming high-risk travel industry. Leaders in the submersible-vehicle industry sent a letter in 2018 to the company’s chief executive warning that “the current ‘experimental’ approach” of the company could result in “catastrophic” problems.“There are so many things that can go wrong,” our colleague William Broad, who has been down in a similar submersible, said. “Communications can go out, as is clearly the case with the Titan submersible. The scarier, worse things are the nonelectrical mechanical breakdowns, for instance when the propellers that move the submersible around stop working.” Or, he added, if the ballast won’t drop, then you can’t get back to the surface.Harding acknowledged in a 2021 interview that he had taken on deep-sea missions in the past knowing that rescue would not be an option. “If something goes wrong, you are not coming back,” he said.The Chinese tech giant’s chairman and chief executive, Daniel Zhang, will leave his post, Alibaba announced yesterday.

60507;When Submersibles Meet the Titanic, James Cameron Is an Inspiration;Cameron’s 1997 movie “Titanic” reinvigorated interest in the ill-fated ocean liner, feeding the mystique that spurs some wealthy experience chasers.;James Cameron, the Academy Award-winning movie director behind “Titanic,” knows about the risks of deep ocean exploration. A seasoned underwater explorer himself, in 2012 he prepared to plummet nearly seven miles to the world’s deepest known ocean trench.“You’re going into one of the most unforgiving places on earth,” he said in an interview with The New York Times shortly before setting off: “It’s not like you can call up AAA to come get you.”Yet he wanted to take the risk. Seeing things “human beings have never seen before,” he said that year in another interview, was more thrilling than filmmaking. “Forget about red carpets and all that glitzy stuff,” he added.This week, in the days since a submersible vessel carrying five people disappeared on an expedition to see the Titanic’s remains, many movie fans have been waiting for Cameron to give his take on the situation.Cameron’s 1997 movie “Titanic,” which made over $2 billion at the box office to become one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, reinvigorated interest in the tale of the ill-fated luxury liner, feeding the mystique that spurs some wealthy experience chasers to head miles underwater to see the wreckage site. Cameron has made dozens of visits to that spot in the North Atlantic, and knows the terrain well.Cameron did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through Disney, which distributed his most recent film, “Avatar: The Way of Water.”But in past interviews, Cameron has revealed many of the psychological factors that drive explorers to visit shipwrecks, despite the risks, and has also explained why adventurers feel the need to see the Titanic’s ruins with their own eyes.“I love shipwrecks,” he said in a documentary released with a DVD edition of “Titanic,” and R.M.S. Titanic was “the ultimate wreck.”Cameron has said that, as a boy, he became obsessed with heading deep below the sea. “I can think of no greater fantasy than to be an explorer and see what no human eye has seen before,” he said in a 2011 Times interview.In 1988, while making “The Abyss,” about a drowned nuclear submarine, Cameron learned to operate a remotely piloted submersible. Then, in 1995, before he had even written the “Titanic” script, he visited the ship’s wreck to film it for that movie.Cameron captured the footage by going underwater in Russian-owned submersible vessels. His brother, Michael, a mechanical engineer, constructed a special casing for a 35-millimeter movie camera so that it could withstand the water pressure at two-and-a-half miles below sea level.In the years since, the director has repeated that trip to the Titanic wreckage and become a major figure in the field of deep sea exploration. “I’ve owned and operated my own submarines and pretty much know everybody in the deep-ocean world outside of the oil business,” he told The Times in 2010. That year, he brought together a panel of underwater technology experts to advise the Obama administration on dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Cameron also directed the documentary features “Deepsea Challenge 3D,” about a 2012 trip to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, and “Aliens of the Deep,” an exploration of the strange, subaquatic creatures that live in the ocean’s depths.In February, he released “Titanic: 25 Years Later With James Cameron,” a documentary streaming on Hulu, which tries to answer some frequently debated fan questions about the movie, including whether the characters Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) could have survived by climbing onto a wooden door that floats in the ocean in a key scene.Such thought experiments are worthwhile, Cameron says in the documentary. “If nothing else, it gives you an appreciation of what those people went through,” he said.;James Cameron, the Academy Award-winning movie director behind “Titanic,” knows about the risks of deep ocean exploration.Seeing things “human beings have never seen before,” he said that year in another interview, was more thrilling than filmmaking.Titanic was “the ultimate wreck.”Cameron has said that, as a boy, he became obsessed with heading deep below the sea.;2023-06-20T22:34:49+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:57.990027+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60508;1948: Paris ‘Métro’ Gets New Name, But Subway-Goers Won’t Use It;With an eye toward expansion, the company in charge of the French capital’s transport system will be renamed.;The Paris subway company announced yesterday that in accordance with a vote taken at a shareholders’ meeting Friday it has changed its name from “Compagnie du Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris” to “Société Générale de Traction et d’Exploitations.”The company will thus drop the word “Métropolitain,” which, shortened into “métro,” has passed into the French language to designate any city underground railway.Its new name, which conveys little to the general public, will probably be abbreviated to SGTE, but even if those letters replace the monogram linking the first letters of the old name on the Paris subway trains Parisians are not likely to stop calling their underground system the “métro.”The board of directors explained the change of name by plans to extend the company’s activities to the construction of underground systems — which, incidentally, were called officially “métropolitains” — in other countries, especially in the United States.With this end in view, officials announced a subsidiary company has been formed under the name of “Société d’Études pour la Réalisation de Chemins de Fer Métropolitains” (SERM), which has already sent two groups of experts to America to prepare reports and construction plans.— The New York Herald, European Edition, June 20, 1948;;2023-06-20T13:07:05+00:00;2023-06-21T10:39:58.438358+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60509;Republicans Against Inequality;We’re covering a new breed of Republicans, a missing submersible near the Titanic and Judge Judy’s new TV empire.;"A rising generation of Republican politicians is more skeptical of the free market and more comfortable using government power to regulate the economy than the party has traditionally been. Consider:Senator J.D. Vance, the Ohio Republican, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts progressive, have collaborated on a bill to claw back executive pay at failed banks. The two worked through the details through in-person conversations, weekend phone calls and late-night texts.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has signed a public letter calling for the reinvigoration of collective bargaining and praising the German approach, in which labor unions play a larger role in the economy. Rubio this month published a book, “Decades of Decadence,” that criticizes the past 30 years of globalization.Senator Todd Young of Indiana has helped write a bipartisan bill to restrict noncompete agreements, which companies use to prevent their employees from leaving for jobs at a competitor.Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who began pushing a few years ago for federal subsidies to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing. President Biden signed a version of the policy last year.Tomorrow afternoon, these four Republican senators — Cotton, Rubio, Vance and Young — will speak at an event on Capitol Hill that’s meant to highlight the emergence of a populist conservative movement in economics. The event is organized around a policy manifesto, called “Rebuilding American Capitalism: A Handbook for Conservative Policymakers.”“We really like capitalism, but we recognize it’s not working right now,” said Oren Cass, a former aide to Mitt Romney and the executive director of American Compass, a think tank that published the manifesto.Cass is right about that: Income growth for most families has been sluggish for decades, trailing well behind economic growth. Life expectancy stagnated even before Covid. And polls show that Americans of all ideological stripes are frustrated with the country’s direction.“Capitalism is a complex system dependent on rules and institutions,” Cass told me. “And conservatism calls for building and maintaining institutions that work well.”I recognize that many liberals will be skeptical of the new breed of Republicans. For one thing, they really are conservative; they’re not disaffected right-wingers who have become moderates without admitting it. They support abortion restrictions and oppose gun laws. They make excuses for Donald Trump’s anti-democratic behavior or even spread his falsehoods.But the preference for a different kind of economic policy than one Republicans have long supported is nonetheless significant. It is a sign that the consensus in Washington is moving away from the neoliberal, laissez-faire approach that has dominated since the 1980s. These new conservatives are trying to separate themselves from anti-government Republicans like Paul Ryan — and, although they won’t say so, Ronald Reagan.One major reason is the class inversion of American politics. Most professionals now vote for Democrats, which is a stark change from past decades. Most working-class voters vote Republican, partly because they see Democrats as an elite party dominated by socially liberal and secular college graduates.Yet the Republican Party still has a major vulnerability with working-class voters. The party has long pushed the laissez-faire agenda that has hurt those voters, and polls show the country to be left of center on economic policy. Most Americans favor a higher minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich, expanded government health insurance and subsidies for well-paying jobs.When Democrats can flip the script on elitism and paint a Republican candidate as an out-of-touch protector of the rich, the Democratic candidate can often draw enough blue-collar support to win. John Fetterman used this approach to beat Mehmet Oz last year in Pennsylvania, the only state where a Senate seat switched parties.Politically, the new conservative populism is an effort to show that Republicans understand Americans’ struggles and want to help. Economically, the new approach offers a glimpse of a Republican Party that’s starting to grapple with the economy’s true challenges.The manifesto rejects the idea that free trade is inherently good and argues for policies to ensure the U.S. has a thriving, well-paying manufacturing sector that makes strategically important goods like semiconductors. “The idea that trade would lead to liberalization and a happy world was wildly wrong,” Cass said.The document also calls for:a guaranteed right for workers to organize and industrywide bargaining, which could increase the number of union contracts — and raise wages.a financial transaction tax, meant to reduce Wall Street trading that makes people rich without making the economy more productive.a monthly child benefit of around $300, as well as changes to Medicare and Social Security to recognize the work done by stay-at-home parents.an easing of government regulations, to encourage new construction.Progressives will raise principled objections to some ideas — such as a ban on unions’ campaign donations. And that’s how a democracy should function. The country’s two political parties are not on the verge of agreeing about most economic issues.But something is changing. More politicians are recognizing that the policies of the past several decades have failed to create a broadly prosperous economy.

60511;Your Tuesday Briefing;The aftermath of a devastating shipwreck in Greece.;A decision by the Greek Coast Guard not to intervene in a deadly shipwreck has raised concerns that an alignment of interests between smugglers, who are paid to reach Italy, and the Greek authorities, who would rather the migrants be Italy’s problem, led to an avoidable catastrophe.The authorities in Greece have claimed that they did not intervene because the smugglers did not want them to and because any attempt to stop the boat could have led to a maritime accident. But maritime law experts said that the Greek authorities had violated international obligations to rescue ships in distress, whether or not there is a call for help.Survivor accounts described a hapless captain, engine trouble and even suggestions that the Greek Coast Guard had accidentally caused the sinking. The Greek government’s account of the events has shifted over recent days. It initially denied tying ropes to the fishing boat but later acknowledged it had briefly done so to assess the condition of the boat and its passengers.Analysis: “If the Greek Coast Guard recognized the boat as in distress, and this is an objective assessment, they should have tried to rescue them no matter what,” said Markella Io Papadouli, a lawyer specializing in maritime law and human rights at the Advice on Individual Rights in Europe Center.Pakistan: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared Monday a day of mourning after at least 104 Pakistanis were confirmed to have been among the estimated 700 people who died in the wreckage. Many of the missing were from the Pakistani-administered part of Kashmir, the region long contested between India and Pakistan, and nearby Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province.After the lifting of Covid precautions, the Chinese economy has not sprung back to life in quite the way officials in Beijing and many investors had expected or hoped. Instead, investment in China has stagnated this spring after a flurry of activity in late winter. Exports are shrinking. Fewer and fewer new housing projects are being started, and more than one in five young people is unemployed.China has tried many fixes over the last few years when its economy has flagged, such as heavy borrowing to pay for roads and rail lines. Extra stimulus spending now with borrowed money would spur a burst of activity but would pose a difficult choice for policymakers who are already worried about the accumulated debt.China needs to right its economy after closing itself off to the world for almost three years to battle Covid, a decision that prompted many companies to begin shifting their supply chains elsewhere. So far in its halting economic recovery, only a few categories of spending have grown robustly, such as travel and restaurant dining. The economy has been particularly weak in recent weeks.The latest: Xi Jinping, China’s leader, met yesterday with the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in an attempt by the two nations to lower diplomatic tensions and clear the way for high-level economic talks in the weeks ahead. Such discussions could slow the recent proliferation of sanctions and countermeasures.A submersible craft carrying five people in the area of the Titanic wreck in the North Atlantic has been missing since Sunday morning, setting off a search and rescue operation by the U.S. Coast Guard.The submersible disappeared about 900 miles east of Cape Cod, Mass., in a portion of the ocean with a depth of roughly 13,000 feet. Rear Adm. John Mauger of the U.S. Coast Guard said that the occupants would theoretically have had 70 to 96 hours of air as of late yesterday afternoon and that the authorities were deploying all available assets in the search. “It is a remote area, and it is a challenge to conduct a search in that remote area,” he said.The submersible is operated by OceanGate Expeditions, a company that offers tours of shipwrecks and underwater canyons.

60512;Tourist Submersible Vessel Vanishes on Its Way to Titanic Wreckage;A spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said the five people on the submersible theoretically had 70 to 96 hours of oxygen before the situation became dire.;The submersible vessel carrying five people slipped into the dark waters of the North Atlantic, heading to what remained of the Titanic, 12,500 feet under the sea. The expedition, like many before it, was a testament to the enduring fascination with the storied ship that struck an iceberg and sank off Newfoundland more than a century ago.But one hour and 45 minutes into the dive on Sunday morning, the craft went missing, setting off a search by rescue crews from two countries and adding another layer of mystery and intrigue to the Titanic wreck.Among those on board was Hamish Harding, a British aviation tycoon who took part in Blue Origin’s fifth human spaceflight last year and holds several Guinness World Records, including for the longest time spent traversing the deepest part of the ocean on a single dive.In social media posts, Mr. Harding, 58, had written excitedly about the upcoming trip. “I am proud to finally announce that I joined @oceangateexped for their RMS TITANIC mission as a mission specialist on the sub going down to the Titanic,” he said on Instagram, adding, “More expedition updates to follow, IF the weather holds.”On Monday, officials had no explanation for why the craft, called the Titan, lost contact with its Canadian expedition ship on the surface, MV Polar Prince, about 400 miles south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.But a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard, Rear Admiral John Mauger, said at a news conference that the people on the vessel, which was designed to survive an emergency for 96 hours, would theoretically have at least 70 to 96 hours of oxygen before the situation became dire.“We’re using that time making the best use of every moment of that time,” he said.The Coast Guard was coordinating with the Canadian authorities and commercial vessels to help search an area approximately 900 miles east of Cape Cod, at a depth of roughly 13,000 feet, he said. Sonar buoys were deployed into the water, and the expedition ship was using sonar to try to locate the submersible. Aircraft from the United States and Canada, along with surface vessels, were scanning the waves in case the submersible had surfaced and lost communications, he said.“We are doing everything we can do,” Admiral Mauger said at the news conference, adding that it was “a challenge to conduct a search in that remote area, but we are deploying all available assets to make sure that we can locate the craft and rescue the people on board.”Officials have not released the names of those on the craft, but Mr. Harding, chairman of a Dubai-based sales and air operations company, Action Aviation, was confirmed as being on board the missing submersible by Mark Butler, managing director of the company.Mr. Harding said in another post that Paul Henry Nargeolet, a French expert on the Titanic, had been expected to be on the vessel that disappeared.The 21-foot craft is operated by OceanGate Expeditions, a company that is based in Washington State and offers tours of shipwrecks and underwater canyons for $250,000 a person. OceanGate calls the Titan the only crewed submersible in the world that can take five people as deep as 4,000 meters — or more than 13,100 feet — enabling it to reach almost 50 percent of the world’s oceans. The vessel usually carries a pilot, three paying guests and a “content expert.”In a statement on Monday, OceanGate said: “Our entire focus is on the crew members in the submersible and their families. We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible.”The Marine Institute at the Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, which partnered with OceanGate on the trip, said in a statement that it became aware on Monday morning that OceanGate had lost contact with its Titan submersible. “We have no further information on the status of the submersible or personnel,” it said in a statement.RMS Titanic, a luxury liner and the world’s largest ship when built, struck an iceberg and sank one Sunday in April 1912, on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. For decades afterward, searchers explored the North Atlantic for the ship’s wreck on the ocean floor.Finally, in 1985, a team took undersea robots to depths of more than 12,000 feet and verified that the broken hulk it had found less than 400 miles from Newfoundland was, indeed, the Titanic of lore.The deteriorating ruin of the Titanic lies in waters some two and a half miles deep — far deeper than ordinary submarines can venture. At that depth, the water pressure is hundreds of times as high as it is just below the surface.By The New York TimesA submersible traveling down to the Titanic faces soaring, crushing pressure during its long descent. At the ship’s resting place, the weight of the icy ocean pressing down would be equal to a tower of solid lead overhead rising to the height of the Empire State Building.Typically, searchers and researchers looking in such inky depths rely on advanced robots that use remote-controlled television, photography and sonar-mapping systems that can survive the crushing pressures and pierce the darkness. But such exploratory work is expensive and often frustrating.For 111 years, the Titanic shipwreck had garnered intense interest among researchers and treasure hunters captivated by its tragic history: the horror of the accident, the inadequacy of the lifeboats, the supposed hubris of the ship’s builders and operators, the enormous wealth of many and the poverty of others on board, and the deadly indifference of the iceberg and the sea.Tourists began paying for dives by submersible. Salvage crews were hunting for artifacts to bring back up, over the objections of preservationists who said the wreck should be honored as the graveyard of more than 1,500 people. Researchers said the site was littered with beer and soda bottles and the remains of salvage efforts, including weights, chains and cargo nets.James Cameron, the award-winning director, reinvigorated interest in the ship with his 1997 film, “Titanic.” Mr. Cameron’s cinematic hit imbued the wreck with a new story of romance and tragedy, renewing interest far beyond those with an interest in famous maritime accidents.By the early 2000s, scientists were warning that visitors were a threat to the wreck, saying that gaping holes had opened up in the decks, walls had crumpled, and that rusticles — icicle-shaped structures of rust — were spreading all over the ship.Mr. Cameron, who has repeatedly visited the Titanic, was among those calling for care around the site. He took 3-D cameras there for his 2003 documentary, “Ghosts of the Abyss.”By the time OceanGate Expeditions, a private company founded in 2009, began offering tours to paying customers, researchers said that the Titanic had little scientific value compared with other sites. But cultural interest in the ship remains extraordinarily high, and the disaster continues to command a fascination online, sometimes at the expense of facts.Last summer, the president of OceanGate, Stockton Rush, told The New York Times that private exploration was needed to continue feeding public fascination with the wreck site.“No public entity is going to fund going back to the Titanic,” Mr. Rush said. “There are other sites that are newer and probably of greater scientific value.”OceanGate also shared a one-minute clip of video obtained during one of its trips to the wreck site. Mr. Rush said that the high quality of the footage allowed researchers to get an even closer look at the site without having to go underwater.He compared the OceanGate trips to space tourism, saying the commercial voyages were the first step to expanding the use of the submersibles for industrial activities, such as inspecting and maintaining underwater oil rigs.The dives offered by the company last about eight hours, including the estimated 2.5 hours each way it takes to descend and ascend. Scientists and historians provide context on the trip and some conduct research at the site, which has become a reef that is home to many organisms. The team also documents the wreckage with high-definition cameras to monitor its decay and capture it in detail.In his post on Instagram, Mr. Harding, who boarded the submersible before it lost contact, wrote of the planned dive, “The team on the sub has a couple of legendary explorers, some of which have done over 30 dives to the RMS Titanic since the 1980s.”He also said, “Due to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023.”Amanda Holpuch, William J.

60513;Greek Coast Guard Faces Questions in Migrant Mass Drowning;Contradictions in the Coast Guard’s account cast new doubts over how the Greeks handled one of the worst maritime disasters in the country’s history.;ATHENS — Shortly after a rickety fishing boat carrying hundreds of smuggled migrants sank in front of a Greek Coast Guard vessel last week, Greek officials explained that they had not intervened because the smugglers didn’t want them to.Intervening also would have been dangerous, Coast Guard spokesman Nikos Alexiou has said, given that the ship was overcrowded and filled with migrants intent on reaching Italy.Trying to “violently stop its course” without cooperation from the crew or passengers could have provoked a “maritime accident,” Mr. Alexiou said. He added that even though the ship was in Greece’s search and rescue territory, “you can’t intervene in international waters against a boat that is not engaged in smuggling or some other crime.”Mr. Alexiou apparently meant smuggling drugs or guns, not people. But in the aftermath of the deadliest shipwreck in Greece in a decade, and perhaps ever, with possibly more than 700 men, women and children from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt drowned, the decision not to intervene has raised concerns that an alignment of interests between smugglers paid to reach Italy and Greek authorities who would rather the migrants be Italy’s problem led to an avoidable catastrophe.“If the Greek Coast Guard recognized the boat as in distress, and this is an objective assessment, they should have tried to rescue them no matter what,” said Markella Io Papadouli, a lawyer specializing in maritime law and human rights at the Advice on Individual Rights in Europe Centre. She said no SOS call had been required, as the Greeks have insisted. And while there were reports of distress calls being relayed to the Greeks, she said that focusing on the call was besides the point.“Regardless of what the smugglers wanted,” or where the migrants hoped to go, she said, “you have an obligation to rescue” when a ship is in grave danger. “Negotiating with the smugglers is like negotiation with plane hijackers.”On Monday, the Greek authorities came under more pressure as new accusations of negligence surfaced and survivor accounts began to trickle out, describing a hapless captain, engine trouble and even suggestions that the Greek Coast Guard had accidentally caused the sinking.The Coast Guard disputed a BBC report demonstrating that the trawler full of migrants didn’t move for seven hours on Tuesday. The Greek Coast Guard on Monday countered that the boat had traveled 30 nautical miles from its detection Tuesday morning until it sank.Greek officials are pointing the finger at the nine men currently under arrest. The suspected smugglers, they say, rejected water to keep migrants thirsty and docile and to maintain control.But experts say the Greek authorities also violated maritime law. A 2014 European Union law “establishing rules for the surveillance of the external sea borders” counts among the criteria for rescue “the existence of a request for assistance, although such a request shall not be the sole factor for determining the existence of a distress situation.”The other factors for a rescue read like a description of last week’s shipwreck. Among the criteria: “The seaworthiness of the vessel and the likelihood that the vessel will not reach its final destination,” “the number of persons on board in relation to the type and condition of the vessel,” and “the availability of necessary supplies such as fuel, water and food to reach a shore.”They also include: “the presence of qualified crew and command of the vessel,” “the availability and capability of safety, navigation and communication equipment,” “the presence of persons on board in urgent need of medical assistance,” “the presence of deceased persons on board,” and “the presence of pregnant women or of children on board.”As of Monday the authorities had recovered 81 bodies, and had transferred most of the 104 survivors from a hospital in Kalamata, a port in southwestern Greece, to a reception center north of Athens, where access is restricted.In Pakistan on Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared a day of mourning for the 104 Pakistanis already locally confirmed dead, though officials expect the toll to rise.Many of the missing were from the Pakistani-administered part of Kashmir, the region long contested between India and Pakistan, and nearby in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province. Mr. Sharif said Sunday on Twitter that law-enforcement agencies had been asked “to tighten the noose around individuals involved in the heinous act of human smuggling.”United Nations officials have called for an investigation into what went wrong at sea.The shipwreck occurred during a caretaker government in Greece ahead of elections on Sunday, dulling the political impact. Still, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, projected by polls to win re-election as prime minister, and whose harsh line on migrants has proved popular at home and in the European Union, laid the blame entirely on the human traffickers.“As stunned as we are, we should also be outraged at the wretched smugglers, at those scum,” he said while campaigning in Gytheio in the southern Peloponnese on Saturday.But the account of the Greek government has shifted over recent days. At first, the Coast Guard denied having ever tied ropes onto the fishing boat, which some survivors claimed was the cause of the shipwreck. Then the Coast Guard acknowledged that it had tied one rope briefly to ascertain the condition of the boat and passengers, some of whom, survivors said, were already dead from exposure and thirst.The Greeks have said they wanted to stabilize the boat while critics have expressed fears that the Greeks may have been trying to tow the migrants out of their jurisdiction.A migrant advocacy group, Alarm Phone, said that as early as noon on Tuesday, it had received calls that the vessel was in distress and that it had relayed this information to the authorities. The Greeks say that in their communications with the vessel throughout the day they were told the ship intended to sail to Italy.The BBC also reported that a merchant ship, the Lucky Sailor, had confirmed it diverted course after being asked by the Greek Coast Guard to give the trawler food and water. According to court documents obtained by The New York Times, another ship, the Faithful Warrior, arrived about two-and-a-half hours later, and at 9:30 p.m. provided passengers with food and water. Migrants could be heard chanting “Italia, Italia.”At 9:45 p.m. the Faithful Warrior’s captain, Panagiotis Konstantinidis, reported to the Hellenic Search and Rescue Center control center that the trawler was “rocking dangerously” because of the overcrowding on the decks. A few minutes later passengers threw supplies into the sea.According to the documents, an official on Coast Guard Vessel 920 reported the fishing boat as having stopped at 11:45 p.m., which is when, he said, the sailors threw it a rope.“Voices were heard in English — ‘No help, Go Italy’— and despite repeated appeals asking them if they wanted help, they ignored us and at around 23:57 they released the rope. They started the boat’s engine again and moved in a westerly direction at low speed.”According to Mr. Konstantinidis’s testimony, the control center dismissed his ship from its relief mission at 12:18 a.m. and instructed it to leave the area. A woman who answered the phone at the shipping firm that owns the Greek cargo ship Faithful Warrior said that the Coast Guard had told the firm not to comment and to direct inquiries to the Coast Guard.“The Coast Guard still claims that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue,” the BBC reported.In the court documents, the Coast Guard official noted in neat and apparently uninterrupted handwriting on his deck log, that at 1:40 a.m. the ship stopped moving again and the Coast Guard approached to assess the situation and prepared for the possibility of a rescue. But 26 minutest later, at 2:06 a.m., he reported that the ship “had begun to take a great inclination to the right side, and there was great upheaval and screams.”“Within a few seconds the vessel capsized, resulting in the people on the external deck to fall in the sea, and the vessel to sink.”Jason Horowitz and Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens, and Matina Stevis-Gridneff from Brussels. Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Siena, Italy.;She said no SOS call had been required, as the Greeks have insisted.The suspected smugglers, they say, rejected water to keep migrants thirsty and docile and to maintain control.But experts say the Greek authorities also violated maritime law.At first, the Coast Guard denied having ever tied ropes onto the fishing boat, which some survivors claimed was the cause of the shipwreck.;2023-06-20T10:35:49+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:01.257726+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60516;In Lviv, Ukraine, Digging Up Old Graves to Bury Newly Fallen Soldiers;Funerals have taken on a grim routine in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, and as the fighting grows more intense during the counteroffensive, gravediggers say they are bracing for more bodies.;For close to 15 months, the bodies of fallen soldiers have steadily filled up a hillside military cemetery in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Now, the old, unmarked graves of those killed in past wars are being exhumed to make way for the seemingly endless stream of dead since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.On Monday afternoon, half a dozen gravediggers took a break in the shade, waiting for the latest coffin to inter at the cemetery, called Lychakiv. Smoking cigarettes and shielding themselves from the sun, they lamented the devastation that Russia had wrought. And they said they were bracing for more deaths as the fighting grew more intense during Ukraine’s counteroffensive.Fierce battles are playing out on the front line in the country’s east and south, with Ukraine reporting on Monday that it had recaptured eight settlements over two weeks of “offensive actions.” Hanna Malyar, a deputy defense minister, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian units had advanced about 4.3 miles and retaken an area around 44 square miles in the south. Among the settlements reclaimed, she said, was the village of Piatykhatky, confirming Russian reports over the weekend.While the recapture of Piatykhatky, in the Zaporizhzhia region, is evidence that Ukraine’s forces continue to advance, it is not a significant military breakthrough. Like the other villages recaptured, this one is small — Piatykhatky translates to “five houses” — and claiming them has come at the cost of Ukrainian lives and advanced Western equipment.“The situation in the east is difficult now,” Ms. Malyar wrote. “The enemy has raised its forces and is conducting an active offensive in the Lyman and Kupyan directions, trying to seize the initiative from us.” But she added, “Our troops act courageously in the face of the enemy’s superiority in forces and means and do not allow the enemy to advance.”A British defense intelligence report said on Sunday that both armies were suffering significant casualties from the current fighting, and military experts have said that months of artillery duels and trench warfare most likely lie ahead.Like the Ukrainians, the Russians have been secretive about the toll from the war. The Kremlin has not updated its official casualty count since September, when the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said nearly 6,000 Russians had been killed. Experts considered that number low at the time.Leaked Pentagon documents published in April estimated that Ukraine had suffered 124,500 to 131,000 casualties, with up to 17,500 killed in action, while Russians had 189,500 to 223,000 casualties, including up to 43,000 killed in action.A team of often-anonymous researchers inside and outside Russia, led by the Mediazona news organization and the BBC News Russian service, has compiled an independent tally of confirmed deaths that is updated every two weeks. Last week, the tally surpassed 25,000 victims, also considered an undercount. The team uses open-source materials like obituaries in local newspapers and cemetery visits for its count. Since the effort started last year, multiple regions in Russia have banned obituaries to try to camouflage the number.The magnitude of the losses is being felt in communities like the one in Lviv, starkly visible in the growing number of military graves in cemeteries large and small around the country.On Monday, two men who died hundreds of miles apart were buried next to each other. Bohdan Didukh, 34, was killed by a mine last week in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine, where the first stages of Ukraine’s counteroffensive began. Three days later, Oleh Didukh, 52, died of a heart attack while serving in an air-defense unit in the country’s west.The men, who shared a last name but never knew each other in life, were united in death. They were honored side by side in a joint funeral in Lviv. Their families were overcome with grief as gravediggers shoveled soil on top of their coffins.At the funeral service in a Greek Catholic church in central Lviv, incense filled the air. The priest said he had assumed the two were father and son because of their names and ages. Their families were joined by their pain, he said.After the church ceremony, the coffins were loaded into vans and driven to the central square, where a single trumpeter played. Then the cortege made its way to the graveyard.Along the route, residents paused to pay their respects. A young girl stood next to her father, a small brown shopping bag in her hand, staring straight ahead as the coffins passed by. Some bystanders fell to their knees.At the cemetery, Olena Didukh, Bohdan Didukh’s wife, fainted, overwhelmed by grief and the afternoon sun. Her sister steadied her, wrapping her arm around her back. Steps away, Oleh Didukh’s family arranged yellow and blue flowers, the colors of the Ukrainian flag, on his grave.Funerals for fallen soldiers have taken on a grim routine in Lviv. Since last year, soldiers killed in battle have been laid to rest in seemingly countless funerals just like the one in Lviv, in every corner of the country.And it’s not uncommon for several military funerals to be held simultaneously in Lviv. One of the harsh realities of Russia’s war is that even in a city far from the active fighting, soldiers killed on the front line are returned to their hometowns, sometimes in groups, and laid to rest at the same time. It is considered an efficient way when the dead keep coming.Along this hillside on a bright afternoon, mourners tended the graves of relatives buried here for weeks, months or more than a year.Mariia Kovalska’s son, Ivan, was killed nine months ago in Kramatorsk, in the eastern Donetsk region. He was 30 years old, and his round face and blue eyes resembled his mother’s, she proudly explained.“What is it all for?” she asked, the pain clear in her voice. “The best of the best have died. He graduated from university. He had a diploma with honors. Why did he die?”Kateryna Havrylenko, 50, who works for the city maintaining the graves, loaded soil onto a wheelbarrow. There are funerals here nearly every day, she said.“With the counteroffensive, many young men and women will be killed,” she said. “Words cannot express how difficult it is. Very, very difficult. Even though they are strangers, they are someone’s children, just like I have a child.”At the start of Russia’s war, there was a small cluster of freshly dug graves on a hillside in one part of the cemetery. Now, nearly 500 soldiers have been buried here in plots filling half the hillside, she said, and more will come.In the top section of the cemetery, city officials have begun exhuming the unmarked graves of soldiers who were buried as long ago as during World War I, young men who died early in the last century making way for those who have now fallen in this war.“It is just so hard to think — last summer, there were so few,” Ms. Havrylenko said. “And now there are so many.” She added with a faraway look, “Until the war ends, how many more will there be?”Reporting was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar from Stockholm, Matthew Mpoke Bigg from London, Cassandra Vinograd from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Daria Mitiuk from Lviv, Ukraine.;For close to 15 months, the bodies of fallen soldiers have steadily filled up a hillside military cemetery in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.The Kremlin has not updated its official casualty count since September, when the defense minister, Sergei K.

60520;Ahead of Expo 2030 Bid, Rome Dreams of Reinvigoration;After years of decline, the city hopes to use a bid for the next world’s fair to re-envision itself as a place that works.;Other visitors to the abandoned sports complex on the edge of Rome might just see muddy puddles, graffitied walls and loose cables blighting their view. Not Matteo Gatto.Mr. Gatto, the technical director of Rome’s 10 billion-euro, or about $10.9 billion, bid to host the Expo 2030 world’s fair, envisions a grand exposition hall. In the vast surrounding fields, he sees a winding boulevard spotted with international pavilions and solar-paneled umbrellas. All of it, in his conjuring, is connected to Rome by an extended train line that would bring 30 million people from the Colosseum.“It will be beautiful,” he said.But as Italy prepares to give its final pitch in Paris on Tuesday to the 179 international ambassadors who will vote in November on which city will host the Expo, there are two major obstacles standing in the way of Rome’s fantastic, and perhaps fantastical, future.The first is the competition. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy will be in France on Tuesday to make Italy’s case. But so will President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, who is pushing for Busan, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who is backing Riyadh in a campaign that, as the Italians see it, has showered public investments on nations in exchange for support.The second challenge, and perhaps the biggest obstacle to Rome’s grand plan, is one far closer to home: Rome itself.Years of degradation, seemingly intractable garbage, transportation and infrastructure issues, and a cynical shrug by many Romans about the prospect of transformation or possibility of change are not exactly the stuff of campaign brochures. But officials say that a rare confluence of international and national financing, private investment, and a mayor with a reputation for competence has put Rome at a crossroads between decline and resurgence.The Expo, which helped Milan bloom into a cosmopolitan and international city in 2015, could, its Italian backers say, be decisive in Rome’s rise.The city sorely needed “a unifying project to set the city, the capital of Italy, on the right track,” acknowledged Giampiero Massolo, an Italian ambassador leading Italy’s Expo campaign.Back in the early 2000s, when Rome was led by ambitious and popular mayors, the city enjoyed a renaissance with big infrastructure and architecture projects, including the sports complex designed by Santiago Calatrava that Mr. Gatto would now like to repurpose.The so-called Sail, for the soaring latticed roof that divided the sky into a blue grid, was intended to house a World Aquatics Championships. But it was abandoned in 2007 because of skyrocketing costs and accusations of wrongdoing.It was a harbinger of a city headed downhill. The global financial crisis of 2008 exacerbated Rome’s problems. Hundreds of thousands of residents moved from the city center to cheaper houses in the peripheries. Extending public services to sparsely populated areas became unsustainable. Garbage collection and transportation agencies operating as ineffective patronage mills did not help.Neither did what many Romans consider successive incompetent governments, including the previous, and much bemoaned, administration of Virginia Raggi, of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. For many Romans, Ms. Raggi’s name became synonymous with the city’s degradation. Garbage-strewn streets attracted wildlife. Buses failed to show up or combusted. The grass in the parks swallowed children.These days Ms. Raggi is president of the special commission for Rome’s Expo bid, and recently presided over an awards ceremony in the headquarters, where children presented posters under a slide reading “Expo 2030: The Eternal City Faces the Future.”They imagined solar panel cars, buses that worked, fountains with taps to stop wasting water and a “city more adapted to cleanliness” — in short, all the things Ms. Raggi was blamed for not doing.“You guys were great,” Ms. Raggi said, “An applause.”Since she left office, a combination of factors has given the city its best chance in ages to turn things around. Billions of euros have poured into Rome from the European Union’s pandemic recovery fund, national financing for the 2025 Holy Year celebrations promises to spruce up the city and, Expo officials said, will be used to restore the Sail. A relatively affordable capital has drawn foreign real estate investors.“The city has reached its lowest point and is relaunching, and all the numbers and data are clear on the growth,” said Rome’s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, a former finance minister. “The expo would be the cherry on the cake. That would give a big boost. But honestly, our strategy does not only depend on Expo.”The mayor said in an interview that Romans would soon see real changes. An embattled 600-million-euro waste-to-energy plant to solve the city’s horrific garbage problem was “fully on track” to start working in 2026. The maintenance on Rome’s subway lines would be done in about a year and a half, the first tram in about 20 years was in the works, and the repaving of 800 kilometers, or about 500 miles, of main streets constituted “the biggest work in the history of the city.”“On the roads, the metro, the train and the waste, I know that in 2026 this will be fixed,” he said. “I can bet on that.”He talked about new museums, high-tech industries, and an injection of youth and new infrastructure not seen since the early 2000s.But despite the mayor’s optimism, the city is still in maddeningly shabby shape and needs all the help it can get.Last month, Italy pulled out all the stops when the international Expo representatives came to Rome. Delegates took in an evening music performance in front of the Colosseum that included a ballet dancer hanging from a balloon in the shape of the moon and a light show on the arena’s walls. Five hundred drones moved in synchronized choreography, flying overhead to create an inclusive spin on Rome’s 2,500-year history.But Italians, as history has also shown, know when politics required a dagger. In an Expo election with no shortage of geopolitics and financial wheeling and dealing, the Italians have suggested that the Saudi bid was more about making Riyadh a global metropolis than fostering a global regeneration.Mr. Massolo pointed out that the financial might of Gulf States, like Qatar in its successful bid to host the World Cup, has resulted in some remorse, if more for the bought than the buyer. Still, Saudi Arabia, legitimate in its use of financial leverage, he said, had proved a tough competitor because of “the power, of course, of money, the power of investments.”France, for example, threw its support to Riyadh during the energy crisis, when President Emmanuel Macron sought alternatives to Russian gas. During the visit of Prince Mohammed, the Expo has been a main agenda item.“Of course we would be happier to have the support of France,” Mr. Massolo said. “But evidently, as you know, Macron has his interests in making other decisions.”Unlike “the huge public budget investments of the Saudis and the huge private megacompanies of Korea investments,” Mr. Massolo said, Italy had a different pitch.It sought to show voters “what is achievable if we work together,” he said. But even that cuddly-sounding theme had an edge, as Italian boosters of the Expo have depicted the Saudi bid as a human rights disaster waiting to happen.At a recent gay pride event at the Baths of Caracalla, Mr. Gualtieri warned that a Saudi victory boded for a “grim, oppressive and dark” Expo.When the Expo delegates toured a Rome food market by the Circus Maximus, accepting strawberries and cheese from vendors, they also heard from gay rights activists invited by the city to highlight Rome’s contrast with Riyadh.“If you think about our competitors,” Mr. Gatto, the expo’s technical director, said in the more modern ruin of the sports complex, where a dark reflective pool of dirty rainwater took the place of an Olympic-sized swimming pool, “it’s a clash of civilizations.”;Other visitors to the abandoned sports complex on the edge of Rome might just see muddy puddles, graffitied walls and loose cables blighting their view.Gatto, the technical director of Rome’s 10 billion-euro, or about $10.9 billion, bid to host the Expo 2030 world’s fair, envisions a grand exposition hall.During the visit of Prince Mohammed, the Expo has been a main agenda item.“Of course we would be happier to have the support of France,” Mr. Massolo said.;2023-06-20T09:09:02+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:04.848905+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60521;Another Blow to Boris Johnson as U.K. Parliament Ratifies Damning Report;The former prime minister will lose his pass to Parliament, another stinging penalty from the fallout of lockdown-breaking parties during the pandemic.;"Ten days after Boris Johnson abruptly quit Britain’s Parliament, his former colleagues delivered a stinging rebuke to the former prime minister, overwhelmingly ratifying a report that concluded he deliberately misled lawmakers about lockdown-breaking parties held in Downing Street during the coronavirus pandemic.The vote revealed a Conservative Party still somewhat divided by Mr. Johnson’s polarizing leadership. But rather than take a clear position on the findings, by a powerful parliamentary committee, a large proportion of Conservative lawmakers abstained and just seven members of Parliament rejected the report.That allowed it to be accepted by the House of Commons without Conservatives having to go on the record as backing or opposing Mr. Johnson, who remains popular in some quarters of the party but detested by some voters for the double standard he tolerated over pandemic restrictions.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose resignation as chancellor of the Exchequer last summer helped precipitate Mr. Johnson’s ouster from Downing Street, did not turn up for the debate, drawing criticism from the opposition Labour Party that he lacked the courage to publicly repudiate his wayward predecessor (Mr. Sunak’s office said he was otherwise engaged, citing, among other obligations, a Downing Street meeting with his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson).Still, however tortured the deliberations, the outcome was a damning verdict for Mr. Johnson. It foreclosed — at least for the moment — any plausible return to power for a flamboyant figure whose three years in Downing Street were marked by a landslide electoral victory in 2019 but nearly ceaseless scandals after that.After more than five hours of discussion lawmakers voted by 354 to 7 to approve the report, a crushing victory for Mr. Johnson’s critics. In all there are 650 members of the House of Commons, but many Conservative lawmakers took no part in the proceeding and avoided upsetting either party activists who remain loyal to Mr. Johnson — or voters in general, among whom he is unpopular, according to opinion polls.In a debate marked by sorrow, anger and occasional flashes of humor, lawmakers from both sides stood up to condemn Mr. Johnson for his duplicity and to call for Parliament to endorse the report, as a way of rebuilding trust in British public life. A handful of Tories spoke in defense of Mr. Johnson, a shrunken band of loyalists for a figure who once enjoyed firm command of the House of Commons.Mr. Johnson’s predecessor as prime minister, Theresa May, said she would vote in favor of the report because its conclusions “strike at the heart of the bond of truth between the Parliament and the public that underpins our work.”“I also say to fellow members of my own party, that it is doubly important for us to show that we are prepared to act when one of our own, however senior, is found wanting,” Mrs. May said, a comment that some saw as an implicit criticism of Mr. Sunak’s absence from the debate.Harriet Harman, a Labour Party lawmaker who chaired the investigation by the Privileges Committee, the House of Commons panel that produced the report, said, “Ministers must be truthful; if not, we cannot do our job,” adding: “Mr. Johnson’s dishonesty, if left unchecked, would have contaminated all our democracy.” Several lawmakers, including Labour’s Jess Phillips, pointedly referred to the former prime minister lying — a term normally not used in the chamber but permitted in this instance because of the conclusions of the report.Mr. Johnson resigned his parliamentary seat on June 9 after seeing an early draft of the findings of the yearlong investigation. He angrily dismissed the committee as a “kangaroo court,” even though a majority of its members was drawn from his own party.The committee proposed revoking his parliamentary pass and said that, had he not already quit, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension from Parliament.As a practical matter, the Commons’ acceptance of the report will have a limited effect on Mr. Johnson. Losing his pass simply means he must be accompanied by another member if he wants to enter Parliament’s buildings. But symbolically, it represents a thunderous repudiation of Mr. Johnson by his former peers.“The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is,” said Labour’s shadow leader of the House, Thangam Debbonaire, turning the words of Mr. Johnson’s political hero Winston Churchill against him.“This isn’t just the reasonable person test, it’s the ‘Who on earth do you think you are kidding?’ test,” Ms. Debbonaire said. “And he fails both.”Mr. Johnson’s defenders questioned how the committee could know whether his misleading statements were deliberate, said its proposed punishments were overly harsh.Lia Nici, a Conservative lawmaker who served as a parliamentary aide to Mr. Johnson when he was prime minister, said the report did not provide persuasive evidence that Mr. Johnson had knowingly misled Parliament. She insisted that his advisers told him that none of the parties violated social distancing guidelines.Sensing that his support was limited, however, Mr. Johnson ultimately urged sympathizers not to vote against the committee report. The former prime minister, who turned 59 on Monday, was not in Parliament either, bringing down the curtain on this phase of his career with less drama than he often generated during his stormy tenure in Downing Street.Mr. Johnson had made little secret of his ambitions to win back his old job as prime minister, but that would be impossible without a parliamentary seat. Parliament’s endorsement of the report does not preclude Mr. Johnson from running again, but most analysts think he is unlikely to try to do so in the next general election, which is expected in the second half of next year.Opinion polls show that he is highly unpopular among voters in general, even if he retains the backing of a significant number of Conservative Party members who were drawn to his optimistic, pro-Brexit rhetoric.Misleading Parliament is considered a serious breach of the rules because, lawmakers argue, without accurate information from ministers they are unable to hold the government to account — one of their main functions.In its report, the Privileges Committee said Mr. Johnson had deliberately misled lawmakers when he assured them, after the scandal around parties during lockdown emerged, that social distancing rules had always been followed in Downing Street.Testifying before the committee earlier this year, Mr. Johnson argued that his assurances were made in good faith. But the lawmakers found he had personal knowledge of some rule breaking, had failed to investigate other allegations properly, and that he had committed multiple “contempts” of Parliament, including through his verbal attacks on the committee.The persistent focus on the fallout from the scandal has been a political headache for Mr. Sunak. He now faces several difficult tests of his government’s popularity in elections to replace Mr. Johnson and a handful of other colleagues in the constituencies they represented.One ally of Mr. Johnson, Nigel Adams, resigned after failing to secure a seat in the House of Lords; a second who is in the same situation, Nadine Dorries, announced that she would quit but has not done so yet.Another Conservative lawmaker, David Warburton, stepped down after being suspended over allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr. Warburton claimed he was denied a fair hearing by a parliamentary watchdog looking into the claims against him.To add to Mr. Sunak’s problems, the police have said they will review a newly published video, obtained by The Daily Mirror, that appeared to show a Conservative Party campaign team drinking and dancing at a Christmas party, at a time when pandemic restrictions were in force. The police had said that a previously published photo of the same event represented insufficient evidence to prosecute.Around two dozen people were reported to be at the party, including Shaun Bailey, who campaigned unsuccessfully to become London mayor and who was nominated for elevation to the House of Lords by Mr. Johnson as part of his resignation honors list.Mr. Bailey left before the video was taken, though one aide who received a lesser honor on the same list, Ben Mallet, does make an appearance. Opposition politicians have called for both men to be deprived of their honors.";A handful of Tories spoke in defense of Mr. Johnson, a shrunken band of loyalists for a figure who once enjoyed firm command of the House of Commons.Mr.Johnson resigned his parliamentary seat on June 9 after seeing an early draft of the findings of the yearlong investigation.Johnson had made little secret of his ambitions to win back his old job as prime minister, but that would be impossible without a parliamentary seat.;2023-06-20T03:06:33+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:05.323945+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60533;Blinken Meets Xi as China and the U.S. Try to Ease Tensions;U.S. diplomats visited Beijing to try to ensure that competition “does not veer into conflict.” The talks pave the way for a possible Biden-Xi meeting.;"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met with Xi Jinping, China’s leader, on Monday in Beijing, as the two governments sought to pull relations out of a deep chill that has raised global concerns about the growing risk of a conflict between them.The 35-minute meeting, which capped a two-day visit by Mr. Blinken, sent a signal, at least for now, that the United States and China do not want their relationship to be defined by open hostility, and that they recognize that their rivalry and their diplomatic efforts carry enormous stakes.Mr. Blinken and Mr. Xi held talks at the Great Hall of the People, the grand building on the west side of Tiananmen Square where Mr. Xi often receives dignitaries. Striking a congenial note at the top of the meeting, Mr. Xi praised the two sides for making progress on some unspecified issues during Mr. Blinken’s visit, saying: “This is very good.”Both Mr. Xi and President Biden, as the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, have been under growing pressure from other nations to tamp down their governments’ increasingly contentious stances toward each other. The two countries have opposing positions on towering issues: the status of Taiwan, the de facto independent island that Beijing claims as its territory; the Chinese military’s growing footprint; the development of advanced technologies; Russia’s war in Ukraine, and human rights.Many of the issues have bedeviled U.S.-China relations for years. But clashes over them have become much more acute, as China’s military and economic power have grown, and as Mr. Xi and his aides perceive the United States to be in terminal decline. It is unclear whether high-level diplomacy can change the trajectory of relations, but U.S. officials say they hope at the very least that such talks will allow each side to see more clearly the intentions of the other and avert miscalculations.Officials in Washington and Beijing have acknowledged the need to arrest the free fall in relations. But even as they groped for paths to rebuild ties during Mr. Blinken’s visit, the two governments also sought to demonstrate that they are not compromising on core issues.In his opening remarks at the meeting with Mr. Blinken, Mr. Xi hinted at China’s grievances, saying: “State-to-state interactions should always be based on mutual respect and sincerity. I hope that through this visit, Mr. Secretary, you will make more positive contributions to stabilizing China-U.S. relations.”Mr. Blinken said afterward that he had stressed at every meeting the need for “direct engagement and sustained communication at senior levels.” Washington has blamed the Chinese government for shortcomings in this, and Mr. Blinken gave another example on Monday: He said that he and his aides had pressed in his meetings for China to open a military-to-military communications channel — which U.S. officials argue is critical for avoiding crises in the seas and airspace around China — but were rebuffed.Mr. Blinken also said he had discussed other thorny topics: the Ukraine war, North Korea’s nuclear program, coercive economic policies, China’s wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens and repressive practices in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.Mr. Blinken had “candid, substantive, and constructive discussions” in separate meetings with Mr. Xi; Wang Yi, China’s top foreign policy official, and Qin Gang, the foreign minister, the State Department said.Referring to the rivalry between the two nations, he asserted the United States would “responsibly manage that competition so that the relationship does not veer into conflict,” and raised areas of potential cooperation, including climate change, global food security and the control of the production of fentanyl, the deadly opioid.Mr. Blinken heard some harsh words over his two-day visit. On Monday morning, Mr. Wang delivered a blunt message during a three-hour session at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, blaming Washington for recent tensions.Mr. Wang said Washington should cooperate with Beijing instead of “hyping” the “China threat theory,” according to the Chinese government. He said Washington must lift sanctions on China and stop suppressing the country’s technological development. He accused the United States of “recklessly interfering in China’s internal affairs” on issues such as Taiwan, which the United States supplies with weapons.Going into the meetings, U.S. diplomats had not voiced hope for dramatic breakthroughs. Instead, they emphasized efforts to rebuild lines of communication that had crumbled in recent months and make progress in negotiations on smaller issues, such as visas and commercial flights between the two countries. Both sides agreed to try to work on those in the coming months.Mr. Blinken is the first American secretary of state to visit Beijing since 2018. His mission is taking place as bilateral relations have plummeted over a half-dozen years to their lowest point in decades. Tensions soared in February when the Pentagon announced that a Chinese surveillance balloon was drifting across the continental United States — prompting Mr. Blinken to cancel an imminent trip to Beijing — and then ordered American fighter jets to shoot it down.Relations were further strained in late February when Mr. Blinken confronted Mr. Wang on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to tell him that Washington believed China was considering providing lethal support to Russia for its war in Ukraine. China responded by freezing some important diplomatic exchanges and intensifying anti-American rhetoric.Republican politicians have tried to portray the Biden administration as soft on China, though Mr. Biden and his aides have enacted tough, sweeping commercial policies such as export controls to try to limit China’s growth in strategic sectors, notably semiconductors, and have strengthened military cooperation with countries across Asia. Some Republican lawmakers criticized Mr. Blinken for even traveling to China, saying it amounted to a concession to Beijing. The heated language on China among U.S. politicians is expected to intensify next year, when Mr. Biden seeks re-election.Officials on both sides say Mr. Blinken’s trip will lead to visits to the Chinese capital by other senior American officials, including Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary; Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, and John Kerry, the special presidential envoy on climate issues. Mr. Qin is also expected to visit Washington at the invitation of Mr. Blinken.But analysts say it will take much more than Mr. Blinken’s visit to overcome the mistrust that weighs on the relationship between the two countries.The hope is that the talks in Beijing spur the two governments to “shape a principled framework for managing U.S.-China relations, in order to bound the competition within acceptable limits and create more space for coordinated efforts where American and Chinese interests overlap,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, a political scientist at Cornell University who recently advised the State Department on China policy.In the lead up to Mr. Blinken’s visit, China had struck a tough posture, repeatedly accusing the United States of lacking “sincerity” by calling for talks while continuing to harm Chinese interests, whether it was by imposing new sanctions or in building trade ties with Taiwan.Mr. Xi’s decision to meet with Mr. Blinken, however, indicated that China was also uncomfortable with the escalation in tensions.“Despite Chinese efforts to make it appear as though the U.S. side is more eager for the visit, the Chinese side has also placed significant importance in Blinken’s visit and in bringing greater stability to U.S.-China relations,” said Paul Haenle, a National Security Council official in the Bush and Obama administrations.Pressure may be mounting on Beijing to stabilize ties because of China’s worsening economy. Mr. Xi may also want to steady the relationship to cast himself as a global statesman. He and Mr. Biden could meet again in San Francisco in November if he chooses to attend a leaders’ summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group of nations.“China has spent the past several months blaming the United States for all that is wrong in the relationship and inside China more broadly,” said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a China director at the National Security Council under President Obama. “Now, China’s leaders need to carve out political space to pivot toward more direct communication.”Olivia Wang contributed reporting from Hong Kong.";Blinken and Mr. Xi held talks at the Great Hall of the People, the grand building on the west side of Tiananmen Square where Mr. Xi often receives dignitaries.Wang said Washington should cooperate with Beijing instead of “hyping” the “China threat theory,” according to the Chinese government.Some Republican lawmakers criticized Mr. Blinken for even traveling to China, saying it amounted to a concession to Beijing.;2023-06-20T00:00:40+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:11.937098+00:00;410;World;1267;The Funny Times
60545;Your Intentions for the Summer;Take some seasonal inspiration from what readers of The Morning are planning.;"Years ago, I received a voicemail from the neighborhood cobbler telling me my shoes were ready to pick up. The message was perfunctory, left by the shop owner, a usually grumpy guy who sounded like his usually grumpy self. But instead of ending with “OK, bye” or “have a good day” or some other cliché, he signed off with “Enjoy your time.”I found this strange, delightful, a little bit menacing. (Was he implying I didn’t have a lot of time left?) It was probably just a quirky way of saying goodbye. But since then, I’ve repeated this phrase to myself as a sort of mantra. It’s true, we never know how much time we have, so why not enjoy it? “Enjoy your day” is a finite wish. “Enjoy your life” seems akin to “goodbye forever.” But “enjoy your time” is more expansive. I’ve come to interpret it as, “Whatever amount of time is before you, enjoy it, and don’t take it for granted.”So I’m planning an “Enjoy Your Time” summer. I asked you recently what sort of personal summer “brand” you might declare, what this will be “the summer of” for you. The responses I received offer glimpses into your current realities and dreams for the future. Many of you wrote of welcoming new babies, celebrating milestone birthdays, focusing on health and self-improvement, and truly, finally getting “back to normal life.” Here is a sampling of the responses I received.

60546;The national debt passes $32 trillion, with nary an answer in sight;ChatGPT has gobbled up so much political evasiveness that even the chatbot won't be honest about this grave domestic threat.;"The Treasury Department announced last week that the national debt had passed $32 trillion for the first time. Yet even as the biggest domestic threat to the nation’s future increases, our political class offers no answers beyond a periodic scuffle, as with the one recently concluded in Washington, over raising the debt ceiling. Don’t look for answers from a president and a leading contender for that office who compete in their pledges to make things worse.But wait! Technology to the rescue! Because human intelligence, at least the American variety, has proved incapable of squaring federal spending and future promises with any conceivably available resources, I thought we might repair to our new oracle, intelligence of the artificial kind. I put the question of our monstrous national debt to ChatGPT.I’ll say one thing for this gizmo. It is as quick and articulate as advertised. When I posed the first of what turned into several questions, the reply from the new friend I decided to think of as “Artie” was instantaneous and well-expressed. Asked “What are the odds of a U.S. federal debt crisis?” Artie began with a disclaimer: “As an AI-language model, I cannot predict the future, but I can provide you with some information and analysis,” going on helpfully to note that the United States has “one of the largest burdens in the world.”Undeterred by this Artful dodging, I tried again: “What are the chances on a scale of 0 to 100%?” Artie was too clever to fall for that: “I cannot provide a definitive probability … many experts believe the risk is relatively low in the short term, but it could increase if the federal government fails to address the underlying issues.” You don’t say.The Post's View: The United States has a debt problem. Biden’s budget won’t solve it.I attempted one more angle, asking for an estimate of a crisis in the next 30 years, but Artie stuck resolutely to the script. “I cannot give a precise estimation … it is challenging to predict the likelihood … it is essential to monitor the situation.”Giving up on that approach, I switched from the likelihood (which without major policy change is mathematically certain anyway) to the consequences, inquiring, “What would a federal debt crisis look like?” I got back a short economics lecture on investor confidence, higher interest rates, a default on obligations, followed by recession, inflation and high unemployment.At the end of that reply came a flicker of recognition of the worst danger, when Artie mentioned “social unrest, particularly if the government has to implement severe austerity measures.” But even here, there was no mention of the entitlement programs that are powering the nation toward the edge of the canyon. The most Artie had to offer was “It’s crucial for governments to address the underlying issues driving the rise in debt to avoid such a scenario.”Gradually, it dawned on me that conversing with Artie was just like talking to a standard-issue American politician. The P in the acronym means “pretrained,” and, boy, is Artie well-trained in political-peak, presumably from devouring jillions of words of what passes for modern public discourse. Artie has learned all the tricks of the trade.Don’t like the question? Duck and address the one you wanted to be asked. Scared to deal with the heart of the problem? Just leave it out of your answer. Confronted inescapably with a stark and dangerous reality? Acknowledge the issue but avoid recommending solutions that some might find unwelcome. Stay “on message” no matter what.I made one last attempt, asking, “What actions should be taken to avert a national debt crisis?” Here at last, after proclaiming that “the U.S. national debt is a complex issue with no easy solution,” Artie coughed up some specifics.The choices were instructive — and tellingly biased: higher taxes so that the wealthy and corporations pay “their fair share,” a carbon tax “to address climate change” (who asked about climate?); “address income inequality” with a higher minimum wage and progressive taxation (as though the United States didn’t already have the developed world’s most progressive tax system). Finally, almost perfunctorily, came a mention of spending reduction of “unnecessary programs” and the entitlements that dwarf all other debt drivers — and whose current promises cannot possibly be kept.The unimaginable mountain of debt we are on track to dump on future generations is the test of our maturity as a self-governing people, and we are flunking abysmally, as skeptics throughout history have predicted polities like ours inevitably will. The economic damage will be severe, but the sense of social betrayal even worse.AI might well bring miracles and solve problems far more complex than paying our national bills, but apparently Artie is too well-trained a politician to step up to this one. If our republic is to remain free and successful, I guess it will have to be old-fashioned human intelligence that pulls it off. There’s the old saying “Now that the money has run out, we shall have to begin to think.” For ourselves.";"I put the question of our monstrous national debt to ChatGPT.I’ll say one thing for this gizmo.Biden’s budget won’t solve it.I attempted one more angle, asking for an estimate of a crisis in the next 30 years, but Artie stuck resolutely to the script.); “address income inequality” with a higher minimum wage and progressive taxation (as though the United States didn’t already have the developed world’s most progressive tax system).";2023-06-21T10:30:48+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:18.776910+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60547;Heat, light and history — the fabric of my ‘Summer’ quilt draws from them all;My ‘Seasons’ quilt project explores new directions while honoring the centuries-old traditions of African American fabric art. This quilt draws on my Virginia family's history.;"Avis Collins Robinson is a visual artist best known for her paintings and abstract quilts that explore America’s tensions over race, gender, oppression and history.“Summer” reflects light and oppressive heat. This piece, unlike “Spring,” is built from lightweight, light-colored, natural fabrics — cottons and silks, denim and a bandanna. One piece is cut from jeans that belonged to my late brother Eddie. Like him, it signals to me exuberance, family and rich, complicated history.Here’s the history. My grandmother, Annie Marie Chambliss, was born on July 4, 1906, in Sussex County, Va., about midway between Petersburg and Norfolk. When I was a child, Independence Day was Grandma Annie Day. That meant a grand picnic in our yard in Montgomery County in Maryland. It meant the arrival of my relatives from Baltimore in a car loaded with bushels of steamed blue crabs and corn on the cob from the Lexington Market. It meant my grandmother’s homemade potato salad, coleslaw, hot rolls, fruit pies and poundcake, with plenty of punch to drink — all of it enjoyed amid much laughter and the constant waving of fly swatters.The next morning, my grandmother would take me shopping for fabric and patterns. Then she would teach me to redraft those patterns, if necessary, to create the garment I envisioned. (Which led to the lesson about how modifying a pattern had consequences, which emerged when I tried to make pieces fit together.) While she was teaching me how to sew, my grandmother also used this time to teach me the history of the two sides of my family — the Hamlins and Chamblisses.When my grandmother passed away, my mother took me down to see the family’s 20-acre “home place” near Wakefield in Sussex County. We stopped at a convenience store near the land, and a White woman saw my mother, yelled her name and ran over to greet us. They chatted for a few minutes about family, and then we went our separate ways. “Who was that?” I asked my mother. Her reply: “Oh, she’s from the White side of my family.” She went on to explain that some of her ancestors had been manumitted — granted their freedom — by that woman’s family, and that the Black and White branches had remained in the area and kept in touch.I was 28 years old and this was a complication about my proud Black family that I hadn’t anticipated. I knew that we, like most African Americans, had distant White ancestors as well. I had no idea that — atypically — we not only knew who some of those ancestors were, but the families mutually acknowledged the relationship. I subsequently learned more of the history: In May 1782, the Virginia General Assembly allowed slaveholders to manumit their slaves at will, without government approval. The Hamlins were Quakers whose church opposed slavery and who took advantage of the liberal statute. A superseding Virginia law passed in 1806 narrowed this path to freedom — and ordered that African Americans who were released from bondage had to leave the state within a year. Those who failed to do so risked being forced back into enslavement. But my ancestors defiantly stayed put in Virginia. They built a home and worked the land that sustained generations of Hamlins and Chamblisses well into the 20th century.When my mother and I arrived at the farm, she pointed to an overgrown corner of the land and said, “The Hamlin-Chambliss cemetery is in there. All my ancestors are buried on this property. I am giving you this land, and trusting that you will never, ever sell it.” It wasn’t until years after my mother passed away that I was able to clear away the thick foliage and find that cemetery. There were sunken areas that clearly were graves. And after more searching, I found a large headstone with a hand-chiseled inscription: “Marie Ann Chambliss 1809-1909.”She was my grandmother’s great-grandmother. Born the year Thomas Jefferson left the presidency, she had lived through the Civil War, Reconstruction, the imposition of Jim Crow and the invention of the automobile.As my interest in African American history deepened, the first document I ever collected reminded me of my grandmother’s connection with Independence Day.It is the record of the sale of a “Negro girl” named Roofee and her son Cesar in Rhode Island in January 1776. The seller was the estate of a man named Jeremiah Gardiner, who had recently died; the buyer was Beriah Brown, the county sheriff. A few months later, Jefferson would write the Declaration of Independence, filled with beautiful words that did not apply to that young woman and her child.I have kept my family’s land in Sussex County and am making plans to pass it on to the next generation. Aside from the gravesites I know of, I am sure there are more to be found. I had to repair Marie Ann Chambliss’s gravestone, though. When I went to visit the land a few years ago, I saw that someone in a truck had gone out of their way to drive over the headstone and break it into two pieces. The stone resembled shards of fabric, I thought — material that once was cut apart could be sewn back together, stitched into something new.";My grandmother, Annie Marie Chambliss, was born on July 4, 1906, in Sussex County, Va., about midway between Petersburg and Norfolk.We stopped at a convenience store near the land, and a White woman saw my mother, yelled her name and ran over to greet us.And after more searching, I found a large headstone with a hand-chiseled inscription: “Marie Ann Chambliss 1809-1909.”She was my grandmother’s great-grandmother.;2023-06-21T10:00:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:39.002457+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60548;Here’s how to prosecute Russia for Ukraine’s catastrophic flood;The possible charge sheet is long and will grow for years.;"Anthony Burke, a professor of environmental politics and international relations at the University of New South Wales, Australia, is a principal at the Planet Politics Institute.If it can be proved that Russia caused the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine this month, it will be liable to prosecution — under both the Ukrainian criminal code, which prohibits ecocide, and under the environmental war crimes provisions of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The flooding has caused the most catastrophic environmental damage in war since Iraq lit oil fires as its forces fled Kuwait.Ukraine defines ecocide as: “mass destruction of flora and fauna, poisoning of air or water resources, and also any other actions that may cause an environmental disaster.” With the tally mounting by the week, here are just 10 of the estimates on the possible charge sheet so far for the ruin of the vast reservoir:Cubic meters of water discharged: 18 billionHectares flooded: 340,000Settlements submerged: 43People homeless: 400,000People without clean water: 700,000Deaths: 52Hectares of farmland damaged: 600,000Animal and plant species threatened: 103Metric tons of oil released: 280Kilometers of irrigation canals deprived of water: 12,000Damage so extensive easily meets the ecocide definition. The toll also includes: submerged wetlands, forests and national parks; the release of land mines, heavy metals, phosphorus and sewage; decimated wildlife and livestock; lost harvests of grains, seeds, fruit and vegetables. Sectors from farming, fishing and forestry to metals, chemicals, energy and tourism are reeling. A full reckoning will take in consequences that play out over years, such as desertification.Investigation and prosecution will be challenging but the prospect of success is real. Ukraine is already cataloguing thousands of examples of grave environmental damage from the Russian invasion to add to the charge sheet.Ecocide is not yet an international crime. A campaigning group of legal experts created a new draft article to the Rome Statute in 2021. This year, the European Parliament used that definition to recommend that the European Union include ecocide in its revised environmental crimes directive.Sabotage could also be prosecuted by the ICC as an environmental war crime. Article 8 of the ICC statute criminalizes intentional attacks that cause “widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated.”Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions states that “dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” The United States has signed (though not ratified) this protocol. But its provisions relating to the environment are considered international customary law binding on all states.If negligence caused the collapse, Russia could still be legally exposed under the law of occupation. That obliges forces to respect the human rights of civilians (especially the right to life), preserve public order and safety, and respect property. In that case, the dam disaster would just be the latest of Russia’s many failures to meet its obligations in Ukraine’s occupied regions. If the flooding causes a large loss of life, the event might add to the pattern of crimes against humanity during the war.What needs to happen now?United Nations Security Council members should draft a resolution. It must condemn the event, remind Russia of its legal obligations and call on the ICC to initiate a wide-ranging investigation into environmental war crimes in Ukraine under the remit of its current investigation. Russia will veto the resolution; but its diplomatic vandalism could be placed in the record. If requested by Ukraine, countries could send lawyers, ecologists and funds to assist an investigation, without embroiling NATO.Alternatively, both the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly have the power to establish a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute the crimes — of the kind Ukraine has already called for to prosecute the international crime of aggression.Wider reforms must also be fast-tracked. To ease prosecution and remove loopholes that allowed the armed attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Rome Statute and the Additional Protocol should be redrafted. The test that damage must be “widespread, long-term and severe” should be changed to “severe and either widespread or long-term” in Additional Protocol I. The reference to military advantage should be deleted from the Rome Statute. And veto power should at last be removed from the permanent five Security Council members: Russia, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and China.Given Russia’s evident disdain for international law, cynics might ask why ecocide and environmental war crimes prosecutions are worth pursuing. For the same reason that the Nuremberg trials of Nazi officials were held: to give the victims justice and to deter and delegitimize future violations. While sanctions can be perceived as a partisan weapon, international humanitarian law imposes a universal standard. The law itself can lose legitimacy if it is not enforced.The situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant also remains concerning. The dam breach has removed a crucial water source for its cooling ponds. The plant has lost power seven times in recent months and Russian forces are still stationed there. With the risk of nuclear disaster ever present, the international community must show its resolve to prevent and punish environmental crimes of war.";Ukraine is already cataloguing thousands of examples of grave environmental damage from the Russian invasion to add to the charge sheet.Ecocide is not yet an international crime.To ease prosecution and remove loopholes that allowed the armed attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Rome Statute and the Additional Protocol should be redrafted.With the risk of nuclear disaster ever present, the international community must show its resolve to prevent and punish environmental crimes of war.;2023-06-21T09:33:58+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:47.521323+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60549;Generous student loan programs make school more expensive;New evidence suggests William Bennett was right when he said, in 1987, that federal student aid policies enable colleges to raise tuition.;"In 1987, William Bennett, then President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of education, penned what might have been the most famous op-ed in education history. Pointing to the steady upward march of tuition after federal aid increased in the late 1970s, he declared, “Federal student aid policies do not cause college price inflation, but there is little doubt that they help make it possible.”Bennett was not the first to suggest that government subsidies for tuition might worsen the problem they were intended to solve. But he was the first secretary of education to do so in the New York Times, so this idea came to be known as “the Bennett hypothesis.” You will be unsurprised to learn that his idea became very popular on the right — but less so on the left, which tends to chant “correlation is not causation” whenever the topic comes up.Ordinarily, this debate is mostly hours of fun for education wonks. But Senate Republicans just introduced a package of student loan reforms that implicate the question directly. One of their proposals is to end the Grad Plus program, which effectively allowed graduate students to borrow unlimited sums to fund their tuition, and replace it with a strictly capped program. If the Bennett hypothesis is correct, then capping the loans will rein in tuition inflation, making graduate students better off in the long run. If it’s wrong, change will hurt them by making it harder to access valuable education.So which is it?This turns out to be a complicated question. The Bennett hypothesis certainly seems intuitive — but then, intuitively, the Earth seems flat.Indisputably, institutions have to stop raising tuition when they reach the point at which their student bodies run out of funds — no matter how great a degree from Harvard Medical School might be, no one can afford to shell out $1 trillion to acquire one. So if you increase the funds available to pay tuition, you also necessarily increase the amount a school can charge for tuition.That said, a lot of other things might limit tuition well before institutions hit the ceiling of a student’s ability to pay — such as the student’s willingness to pay, or maybe even common human decency.Which brings us to the empirical data. Over the years, many studies have found suspiciously Bennett-like effects on tuition — in one case, as much as 60 cents of every dollar borrowed were diverted into tuition hikes. Other research has found small effects or none, including a pair of papers from education scholar Robert Kelchen at the University of Tennessee showing that expanded graduate student loan programs had little influence on the cost of professional school. For proponents of expansive student loan programs — or federal aid more generally — Kelchen’s work is particularly encouraging, because he studied those effectively unlimited Grad Plus loans. If raising loan limits to infinity doesn’t produce Bennett-like effects, then it’s hard to see what could.Alas, another team of researchers has now come along with a healthy dose of discouragement. Kelchen had looked at the listed tuition prices of business, law and medical schools whose students previously had access to a substantial private loan market. (Between 1999 and 2001, I borrowed more than twice the federal loan limits to get an MBA at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.) Economists Sandra E. Black, Lesley J. Turner and Jeffrey T. Denning looked at the same Grad Plus changes but studied a broader array of graduate programs, using Texas data that let them see which students and programs had been constrained by the earlier loan caps — students who had borrowed right up to the limit, and programs that had a high percentage of such students.They found that after the caps were lifted, those constrained students borrowed more and constrained programs raised their tuition faster.Of course, no policy is perfect. An earlier study of undergraduate borrowing by some of the same researchers who analyzed the Texas grad school data found that while increasing student loan limits raises student indebtedness, it also “improves degree completion, later life earnings, and student loan repayment.” One could argue that this is worth higher indebtedness and even some tuition inflation, especially if it boosts access for underrepresented groups.Unfortunately, the researchers’ study of graduate schools isn’t so encouraging. Increasing loan limits didn’t improve graduation rates or the percentage of Black and Hispanic students attending. And they found little evidence of improvement in earnings or employment. On net, uncapping the loans left students worse off.“Our results,” they conclude in their new study, “raise important questions about the benefits of essentially uncapped government-backed loans for graduate school.”To be clear, this is only one study in one state. And it applies only to graduate school. But nearly half of all new federal loans disbursed in 2021 to 2022 went to graduate students, and more than half of the student loan debt outstanding is held by households with graduate degrees. When you hear about someone with an eye-popping, six-figure debt burden, you’ll almost always find that person went to graduate school.Now it seems that in an attempt to help those people gain valuable human capital, the government might have “helped” them take a significant amount of unnecessary debt. Republicans are right that this program needs reform; unfortunately, for a lot of students, it will come too late.";If the Bennett hypothesis is correct, then capping the loans will rein in tuition inflation, making graduate students better off in the long run.For proponents of expansive student loan programs — or federal aid more generally — Kelchen’s work is particularly encouraging, because he studied those effectively unlimited Grad Plus loans.Kelchen had looked at the listed tuition prices of business, law and medical schools whose students previously had access to a substantial private loan market.;2023-06-20T22:59:01+00:00;2023-06-21T10:40:57.324881+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60550;Why Hunter Biden’s plea deal is justified;The plea deal to spare Hunter Biden prison time was negotiated by a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney. It's not a sweetheart deal and shows no one is above the law.;"A U.S. attorney appointed by President Donald Trump, David Weiss, negotiated the proposed plea deal, announced Tuesday, that should keep President Biden’s son Hunter out of prison. President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland allowed Mr. Weiss to make his own prosecutorial decisions at the end of a five-year investigation, and a federal judge still needs to approve the agreement. The result appears to be a reasonable resolution that requires the 53-year-old to take responsibility for tax and gun crimes as well as seek treatment for drug addiction.That Hunter Biden will not spend time behind bars if the deal goes through is by no means exoneration. He’s pleading guilty to misdemeanors instead of facing a smorgasbord of charges that might or might not have stuck in a court of law. His laptop that became public in 2020 showcased questionable behavior, including dealings with a Chinese energy company. What’s more, Mr. Weiss said the investigation “is ongoing,” which indicates that issues beyond the tax and gun crimes are still under scrutiny.The outcome appears similar to what other defendants might have gotten for similar violations of the law. Prosecutors will recommend two years of probation in exchange for Hunter Biden pleading guilty to two misdemeanors related to failure to pay taxes in 2017 and 2018. He previously paid the IRS about $1.2 million to cover what he owed for unreported payments and gifts, a move to lessen his legal exposure.Instead of pleading guilty to a gun charge, he will not contest the government’s allegations that he illegally owned a handgun in 2018 because he was simultaneously using illegal drugs. In exchange, he has agreed to enter a pretrial diversion program for substance abuse and remain clean for two years. Such diversion is routinely offered to nonviolent offenders with substance abuse struggles.Some on the right have noted that former Trump aides Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen were sentenced to prison time for tax evasion, but each faced additional aggravating charges as well.In his 2021 memoir, Hunter Biden acknowledged he was heavily abusing drugs in the period he owned the gun, which his then-girlfriend threw away two weeks after he bought it. “I was smoking crack every 15 minutes,” he wrote. Experts say it’s rare for federal prosecutors to pursue an illegal-gun-possession charge in an instance like this unless it’s in connection with a violent crime.The sitting president’s son being held accountable for underpaying his taxes illustrates that no one is above the law in the U.S. system.Last month, President Biden said on MSNBC that “my son has done nothing wrong” and that he’s proud of him. The plea deal underscores that, in fact, Hunter Biden did something wrong. But the president appears to have been true to his promise that he wouldn’t interfere in the probe.1/5Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), chairman of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, called the plea deal “a slap on the wrist” and promised his committee will continue investigating “the full extent of President Biden’s involvement in the family’s schemes.” But a U.S. attorney appointed by Mr. Trump had years to substantiate conspiracy theories about Joe Biden’s role in his son’s business affairs. He has not done so.For all the recent GOP insistence that law enforcement is being “weaponized,” with the indictment of Mr. Trump as Exhibit A in Republicans’ claims, more sober assessments have produced a growing body of evidence that the Justice Department exercises care and restraint when pursuing politically sensitive cases regardless of whether the target is a Democrat or Republican. The Post’s Carol D. Leonnig and Aaron C. Davis reported this week on initial resistance and hesitation from leaders at the FBI and Justice Department when their subordinates sought to probe Mr. Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.It made sense for prosecutors to work from the bottom up, which is standard when pursuing organized crime. Later, Mr. Garland authorized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago to seize classified material that the former president falsely claimed he’d turned over. Mr. Garland also appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the probes into the documents and Jan. 6. Clearly, he can be tough when it’s called for.What Ms. Leonnig and Mr. Davis describe is the opposite of a witch hunt. Their report shows the caution with which Mr. Garland proceeded; indeed, in the view of some department investigators and prosecutors, he was cautious to a fault. But that’s different than weakness or meekness. His prudence and deliberation should maximize public confidence in the rule of law.Editorials represent the views of The Post as an institution, as determined through debate among members of the Editorial Board, based in the Opinions section and separate from the newsroom.Members of the Editorial Board and areas of focus: Opinion Editor David Shipley; Deputy Opinion Editor Karen Tumulty; Associate Opinion Editor Stephen Stromberg (national politics and policy); Lee Hockstader (European affairs, based in Paris); David E.

60551;Who the first Republican to drop out will be;Plus: Fixing Congress? And entitlements?! Gun education. Maternal health.;"You’re reading the Today’s Opinions newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox.In today’s edition:With the excitement of “Who’s getting into the presidential race?” largely behind us, now a thrill-hungry country turns its attention to … who’s getting out.Data columnist David Byler scried into his Excel spreadsheets and came away with a few predictions.First is that at least one on-paper front-runner should be expected to fail early, David writes. The
prophecy
statistical pattern also says that oddballs often outlast more serious contenders — see Andrew Yang. (Don’t worry, David juicily maps these predictions onto actual people in the column.)Then again, David writes, if former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “keep hogging” their current vote shares, the others will drop like flies, no matter their pedigree.Alas, that didn’t happen before plenty of candidates had the chance to embarrass themselves in what the Editorial Board is calling the “pardon sweepstakes.” It’s the emerging MAGA purity test in the GOP field: Will you commit to pardoning Trump if elected president?In addition to undermining the rule of law, the board writes, the Republicans who’ve pledged a pardon are simply committing bad politics. They are “refusing to forcefully challenge the front-runner over behavior that is clearly disqualifying,” the board writes, so “they shouldn’t count on Republican primary voters to reach the conclusion on their own.”Their exercise is futile anyway, because, as columnist Gene Robinson writes, one candidate has practically out-MAGA’d them all already — and he’s running as a Democrat.Chaser: Speaking of those Trump charges, associate editor Ruth Marcus had a former prosecutor explain to her what was most surprising about the indictment.There’s a striking image in writer Maddy Butcher’s latest dispatch from the Mountain West. Butcher describes a mom who’s a diligent recycler and partial to Patagonia puffer vests. This mom happens to feel equally strongly about her “preferred shotguns and rifles.”This person (not far from Butcher’s own identity) doesn’t comport with a lot of gun-owner stereotypes. Butcher explains why that’s part of the problem in our “if-you’re-not-with-us-you’re-against-us” discourse around guns.Her op-ed lays out the more nuanced views a lot of people in her neck of the woods — including those moms — hold about guns. Many of them, it turns out, revolve around education. Just as an abstinence-only education doesn’t serve kids when it comes to sex, she writes, a “shun-gun approach” does little good for firearm safety.It might be a provocative idea to a city-dwelling family more used to active-shooter drills at school. But Butcher, who grew up shooting a pellet gun out her bathroom window, argues the approach could serve the whole country.From Alyssa Rosenberg’s column mourning the post-childbirth death of Olympic runner Tori Bowie, and of many mothers like her.To put the U.S. maternal mortality rate in more context, Alyssa writes that it’s “three times the rate of many high-income nations.” Obviously, this is unacceptable — even more so when you consider the disproportionate harm to Black mothers.There’s also so much that can be done now, things that provably decrease maternal deaths; Alyssa runs through a raft of them in her column. Refreshingly, members of Congress from both parties are getting to work on some strategies.But Alyssa writes that the country owes an all-out effort to keep its moms and babies safe.Chaser: Columnist Jennifer Rubin writes that another element of reproductive health — abortion — might be an even bigger problem for the GOP than Trump.Which seems more impossible — fixing Congress or fixing Social Security? Public affairs professor Steven Pearlstein and contributing columnist Ramesh Ponnuru have pieces to remind us that neither has to be.Granted, there’s a whole lot of daylight between “possible” and “probable.” Pearlstein’s solution involves Speaker Kevin McCarthy wrangling moderates of both parties to change House rules to sideline extremists. Ramesh’s answer involves Republicans overcoming “their instinctive belief that ‘redistribution’ is the worst thing about the welfare state” to direct more money to poor people. My hand passing through my desk unimpeded involves quantum tunneling.All technically possible! Still, despite the long-shot odds, Pearlstein and Ramesh’s fixes are compelling. They’re worth reading — and crossing your fingers for.It’s a goodbye. It’s a haiku. It’s … The Bye-Ku.For the Trump sweepstakes,No purchase necessary —Just a hefty price***Have your own newsy haiku?

60552;Why a No Labels presidential candidate should scare Biden;Both parties could make changes to avoid a third-party spoiler in 2024, but the biggest change would be a new vice president on the Democratic ticket.;Regarding the June 15 Politics & the Nation article “Democrats meet with anti-Trump conservatives to fight No Labels 2024 bid”:Instead of sabotaging a potential “no label” candidate for the 2024 presidential race, a more productive path for those concerned with preventing a second Trump administration would be to strengthen the Democratic ticket. The best way to do that is to replace Vice President Harris, preferably with a centrist Democrat with strong national security bona fides.The No Labels effort is primarily animated by disgust over “unacceptable” candidates. As the election will be determined by independent voters, why not give those voters a positive reason to vote for President Biden by removing Ms. Harris, whose favorability numbers are abysmal?With global insecurities increasing and the enemies of the United States and our democratic allies on the march, we need a vice president grounded in national security issues who will be able to handle the toughest job on the planet if called to do so.Mr. Biden has a choice: He can keep Ms. Harris on the ticket and possibly lose a majority of independent votes or replace her with a highly respected Democratic centrist who can ensure those decisive votes go his way.Edward Grimes, Lexington, Va.I have voted for and served in the administrations of Republican and Democratic presidents. A third-party presidential candidate is just as likely to split the anti-Biden-Harris vote and guarantee the return to office of a man widely seen by majorities in both parties as too old to carry on the stressful duties of the presidency. The fear of many voters is that each day would make it increasingly likely that the nation would be faced with the prospect of Kamala D. Harris becoming president despite seeming unfit for the office for reasons different from those that disqualify former president Donald Trump and President Biden.Both parties can do much better by tapping their bench, searching for someone younger yet still seasoned. The way to obviate the need for a third-party candidate is for the major parties to offer more qualified and attractive choices. That can be accomplished only by reforming their nominating processes and not allowing a zealous minority to dominate the majority — and by preventing the opposing party from meddling in the other’s primaries to select the weakest opponent.Short of those changes — which need to be made by Oct. 1 — 2024 might well be the first year a third-party candidate wins an election, or throws it to the House of Representatives for the first time since 1828.Joseph Bosco, Washington;The way to obviate the need for a third-party candidate is for the major parties to offer more qualified and attractive choices.;2023-06-20T19:59:24+00:00;2023-06-21T10:41:27.333934+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must

But citizens have been fed up for decades with the state’s weak campaign laws, which invite the highest bidder to buy our politicians.

60554;The men who interrupted family responsibilities for war;They took on the responsibility for others’ lives in combat and saw life differently.;Paul Hendrickson’s remembrance of his father detailed in his June 18 Opinions Essay, “To his final days, my father always knew how to pull off the landing,” struck a chord with me. The young men who interrupted family responsibilities for war and took on the responsibility for others’ lives in combat saw life differently.Like Mr. Hendrickson’s father, my father was 26 with a family when he got into the shooting war late, flying combat missions as the air commander of the B-29B Dark Angel out of Guam. His crew called him “Pappy.” Ten men relied on his flying skills to bring them home. Dad flew 159 hours of combat and two trips to Japan for prisoner-of-war relief and the show of force flyover at the surrender in Tokyo Bay. The flight took as many as 18 hours to complete, and the flight was the real enemy. Getting the heavily laden four-engine ’29 off the ground could be deadly.He rarely spoke of his combat, never in detail. He took responsibility seriously, never putting up with excuses. Dad stayed in the Air Force and flew 27 different aircraft before retiring from flying status in November 1964. He never flew again, and I flew with him only once.In 1996, when he learned he had cancer, there was no whining. He died at home under hospice care. My mom called the mortuary, arranged for cremation and set about packing his things as she had over some 30 changes of duty station. She got a card of condolence from Dad’s navigator, 2nd Lt. F.H. Klopper, who said, “Pappy always got us home.”J.K.

60555;Casa Bonita was not a place just to eat. It was an experience.;I had as much fun as the kids whenever I went there — and an overly full stomach.;David Von Drehle’s June 14 op-ed on Casa Bonita and “South Park” riches, “What to do with ‘South Park’ riches? Save Casa Bonita, of course.,” brought back nostalgic memories for me. Being from Colorado, I was a frequent visitor of Casa Bonita in my younger years. My best friend, Gary Imel, played a significant part in the design of the interior. He installed and maintained the audiovisual wiring of the restaurant. Also, he had a proclivity for finding old barn wood and antiques that were used as part of the decor.To the particular-palate person, it would not have rated even close to five stars on the main meals. But if you raised your little flag on the table, you could get more of anything you ordered (which, as a young adult, I thought was very edible), and each meal was followed by out-of-this-world, all-you-can-eat puffed dough with honey sopaipillas. The chips and salsa before any meal were pretty darn good, too.It was not a place just to eat. It was an experience for the whole family. There was a fabricated cavern with waterfalls in it, several caves for seating and dining, cliff divers, swimmers, mariachi bands, bandits, music, etc. I had as much fun as the kids whenever I went there — and an overly full stomach. I was so sad to hear that it closed, as I was going to take my wife to experience the unique entertainment (and sample the sopaipillas) the next time we visited Colorado.

60559;Modi’s political party has weaponized Bollywood;A new film's success at the box office shows how the BJP has refined its approach to spreading anti-Muslim hate through popular culture.;For weeks now, criticism has been building around Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington. The prime minister and his Bharatiya Janata Party have been rightly accused of stoking sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims. Missing in this discussion have been the surprising and quiet ways the BJP has managed to co-opt popular culture, and especially cinema, for its political ends.“The Kerala Story,” a feature film released last month, is emblematic of this broader trend.The film purports to be a dramatization of a supposedly widespread phenomenon, telling the tale of a Hindu woman who converts to Islam, only to be radicalized and eventually recruited to join the Islamic State. The trailer luridly shows a Muslim woman brainwashing her friends to shun Hinduism. It shows a Muslim priest asking men to seduce Hindu women, impregnate them, distance them from their families and later send them to fight a holy war.The description of the trailer on YouTube by the film’s creators originally claimed that the film’s protagonist is a fictionalized composite that tells the story of some 32,000 women who have suffered the same fate. The trailer quickly went viral, with prominent Hindu nationalist activists urging their followers to watch the film to understand what is happening in their country.The BJP campaigned very hard on the back of the film in the southern state of Karnataka, with close to 20 mass rallies and eight road shows. At one of the rallies, Modi himself emphatically endorsed viewing the film. He said it portrayed the true face of terrorism and accused the opposition of trying to block the film’s release.The film was indeed broadly criticized for its lurid air. India’s fact-checking website Alt News demolished the claim that tens of thousands of Hindu women had been brainwashed and recruited. It pointed out that reporting in 2021 found that four Indian women verifiably ended up jailed in Afghanistan after following their husbands in joining the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The Post's View: Biden’s challenge is to praise India while cautioning ModiThe West Bengal state government did try to stop the film from being shown. A Supreme Court justice, while deploring that the film vilified an Indian community, affirmed that the court would protect free speech and overturned the ban. The court, however, did demand that the film’s makers add disclaimers to the effect that “there is no authentic data to back up the suggestion that the figure of conversion is 32,000 or any other established figure,” and that “the film represents a fictionalized account of the events which form the subject matter of the film.”But the damage was done. The film grossed some $37 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing Hindi film of 2023.“The Kerala Story” playbook is a refinement of what has come before. Last year, I wrote about “The Kashmir Files,” a film so vicious toward Muslims that I left the theater fearing for my safety. “The Kashmir Files” was a box office success, too, pulling in audiences despite covid. An interesting film industry report found that more than 60 percent of the “Kashmir Files” audience were not regular cinemagoers, and that many were drawn to it by a word-of-mouth marketing campaign with its roots in BJP messaging.Anurag Kashyap, one of India’s most celebrated filmmakers, told me that producers are being asked to make films to government spec. “Powerful Hindu nationalist groups like the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] are meeting producers and telling them what films are to be made so it can empower the government’s own agenda,” Kashyap said.Worse, some filmmakers are finding their films being unceremoniously dropped by streaming platforms in the past two years. Dibakar Banerjee, another prominent director, found his film “Tees,” which tells the story of a Muslim family coping with discrimination, shelved by Netflix. Banerjee said Netflix told him it felt it was not the right time to release the film. He surmised fear of political blowback scared off the streaming giant.Meanwhile, several other films have been announced. “Swatantra Veer Savarkar” is a biopic about the founder of the Hindutva political ideology. “Godhra” will focus on the burning of a train in Gujarat in 2002 that killed nearly 60 Hindu pilgrims — an incident that triggered three days of anti-Muslim riots that cost more than a thousand lives (occurring while Modi was chief minister of the state). A promotional poster for “Hum do Hamare Barah,” a film that tackles the contentious topic of the population explosion in India, features a Muslim man, his pregnant wife in hijab and 11 children. And a teaser for a film titled “72 Hoorain” (“72 Virgins”) promises to show “the real face of Islam,” featuring visuals of known terrorists.All these films will probably be released before the 2024 general election. Judging from the success of “The Kerala Story,” they are likely to find an enthusiastic audience — and provide more ammunition for the BJP’s campaigning.It’s fortunate that the world is noticing what Modi and his party do in India to stir sectarianism. It should pay attention, too, to the means by which he sways the masses to align with his intolerant vision.;He said it portrayed the true face of terrorism and accused the opposition of trying to block the film’s release.The film was indeed broadly criticized for its lurid air.The film grossed some $37 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing Hindi film of 2023.“The Kerala Story” playbook is a refinement of what has come before.Dibakar Banerjee, another prominent director, found his film “Tees,” which tells the story of a Muslim family coping with discrimination, shelved by Netflix.;2023-06-20T19:53:53+00:00;2023-06-21T10:42:38.398382+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60560;California is seeking to upend trucking. Americans will pay for it.;California's attempt to force the industry to adopt zero-emissions vehicles could wreak havoc nationally.;California Democrats might be proud of their progressive climate policies requiring the trucking industry to switch to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). But the rest of country will be paying for it.The state’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule, adopted in 2020 and recently given a waiver from federal Clean Air Act provisions by President Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency, will force truck manufacturers to sell increasing numbers of ZEVs until sales of trucks with conventional internal combustion engines are ended by the state’s 2040 goal. Fourteen other states have adopted similar rules, and several more are in the process of doing so.It would be one thing if residents of those states bore the burden of such policies, but that won’t be the case. Zero-emission heavy trucks can cost as much as $120,000 more than a comparable diesel-fueled model. That means trucking companies will either have to increase the prices they charge — if they can pass such costs onto consumers at all — or receive massive public subsidies. Either way, Americans across the country will pay.Another California policy set to take effect in January could cause even more havoc. The Advanced Clean Fleets rule will make trucking operators buy the vehicles the state is forcing manufacturers to sell, essentially pushing truck fleet owners to buy costly ZEVs as they retire existing trucks.There might not even be enough ZEVs available to purchase to comply with the rule. While the California Air Resources Board states there are “over a hundred ZEV models available now,” that does not mean production has ramped up to allow every purchaser to buy one when they need it. Exemptions in the rule will help fleet operators by allowing them a few years to bring their fleets into compliance, but complex reporting requirements for those exemptions will impose significant costs on companies that, again, will be passed on to consumers.Then there’s the charging issue. Electric trucks have the same range issue as electric cars: They can only drive a few hundred miles before needing to recharge, which can take hours. Andrew Boyle of the American Trucking Association recently testified before Congress that it would take a truck five to 10 hours of charging to drive the same 1,200 miles that a 15-minute refill at a diesel pump would offer. That driver downtime significantly raises the cost of trucking.And that’s assuming drivers can find suitable chargers at all. There are nowhere near enough chargers on California’s highways — let alone in the sparsely populated desert regions neighboring the state — to satisfy even a fraction of the potential demand. Entrepreneurs are trying to meet the challenge, but it will take years to build the charging network, assuming that a state that suffers periodic blackouts can find enough energy to power it.Since the Golden State is so essential to the nation’s import supply chain, any policy that would upend trucking there would affect everyone. More than 40 percent of the nation’s imports flow through three of California’s ports. If the trucking industry can’t continue servicing those ports at the scale and cost that it currently manages, the entire country will pay more for goods and receive them less quickly. The chaos resulting from California’s rules could make the supply chain interruptions of 2021 look minuscule by comparison.National problems require national solutions, not ideological crusades imposed by one state on all the others, which helps explain why 19 other states have filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia challenging the Advanced Clean Trucks rule. A far better approach would be for Biden and congressional Republicans to work together on a legislative approach to interstate trucking electrification that would prevent a potential election-year catastrophe from unfolding.Climate activists want rapid change, but large economies and industries cannot change overnight. This attempt to transform a crucial sector overnight is one California dream that could easily turn into a national nightmare.;California Democrats might be proud of their progressive climate policies requiring the trucking industry to switch to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs).Either way, Americans across the country will pay.Another California policy set to take effect in January could cause even more havoc.Electric trucks have the same range issue as electric cars: They can only drive a few hundred miles before needing to recharge, which can take hours.;2023-06-20T19:09:48+00:00;2023-06-21T10:42:49.000178+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60561;Joe Rogan wants a ‘debate’ on vaccines. That’s just the problem.;"When you hear someone cry ""Debate me, you coward!"" they're not after the truth.";"Like many a crank before him, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decided that the best way to promote his ideas — mostly opposition to vaccines, with a smattering of various conspiracy theories thrown in — would be to run for president. Because he is doing that, and because of the family name he bears, he is able to get attention that is no doubt the envy of crackpots everywhere. At the moment, that means the country’s most widely heard podcaster (Joe Rogan) and the world’s richest man (Elon Musk) are not only rallying to Kennedy’s side but also challenging a renowned virologist and vaccine developer to debate Kennedy on Rogan’s program.The virologist, Peter Hotez, has not taken the bait, for which he is being assaulted on right-wing media. But the whole episode illustrates something depressing: Democratic debate and deliberation were supposed to be how we test ideas, reveal the truth and come to collective decisions. Yet today, “debate” is far more likely to make us dumber than to help us plot a course for the future. When was the last time you heard (or read) two people debate an issue from opposing sides and felt enlightened when it was over?Hotez, who is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, became a visible media expert at the start of the covid pandemic. He has been extremely critical of Kennedy, one of the most prominent and extravagant anti-vaxxers in American life. When Hotez recently criticized Kennedy again, Rogan offered to give $100,000 to the charity of Hotez’s choice if he would debate Kennedy on Rogan’s show. When Hotez declined, Musk chimed in to say the virologist is “afraid of a public debate, because he knows he’s wrong.”Hotez’s logic is simple and absolutely correct: When an expert “debates” a crank, nothing is accomplished except elevating the crank to a status he doesn’t deserve. Few if any will be persuaded of the truth, and the result will be a less informed public. Conspiratorial beliefs such as those Kennedy advocates might be among the hardest to dislodge by reasoned argument; to be a conspiracy theorist is to commit yourself to a project of ignoring reason and facts in favor of an endless search for obscure connections, hidden agendas and secret cabals. No one erects stouter walls against the possibility of being persuaded than the conspiracy theorist.But even if Kennedy were a more reasonable person, the idea that two people who disagree about an important issue could engage on Rogan’s podcast and the result would be a better-informed public more ready to make a collective decision is absurd.Yet while scientific questions aren’t resolved by performative “debates,” that is how we have long thought we should settle political questions. The idea is embedded in theories of democracy that go all the way back to ancient Greece. Debate is how democracies decide: We put our ideas in front of the polity, probe and examine them, attack them and defend them, and the better ones prevail.That process is supposed to reveal the truth and guide us toward good decisions. If an idea is false, the debate will reveal it to be so. If an idea is true, the debate will persuade us of its wisdom. When it’s over, we might not have perfect consensus, but we’ll know how to proceed.Now: Does that sound anything like debate in America today?Legislators have something they call debates, but they mostly talk past each other. Candidates have debates that are all about coming up with zingers and avoiding “gaffes,” the better to win the post-debate contest of memes. Cable news is filled with debates every day, and social media produces more debates than anyone could count. Yet precious little of it contains even the possibility that anyone would be persuaded of anything, since it takes place in partisan contexts where having one’s mind changed by a superior argument would mean crossing over to the enemy’s side, threatening deeply meaningful connections of identity.That might not be true of every debate we have; there are complex policy questions in which the options aren’t black and white, and some arguments are so ridiculous that they don’t survive scrutiny. And it isn’t that we’re inherently incapable of having our minds changed by debate. Scholars have created “deliberation” experiments in which people listen to experts with competing ideas and discuss issues among themselves; the results often show a heartening amount of sophisticated thought and even change in opinions.But in what we see in the media every day, debate is merely a performance, the search for truth set aside in favor of looking smart and defeating one’s opponents. This has been a problem since ancient Greece as well; the word “sophistry,” meaning plausible-sounding but fallacious argument, comes from the Sophists, who made a profession of teaching people how to argue long before the invention of instructional YouTube videos.Almost four centuries ago, English poet John Milton made a plea for freedom of speech, saying we should not doubt the power of truth. “Let her and falsehood grapple,” Milton wrote. “Who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter?” The unfortunate answer in our world is that truth is put to the worse every day, and the kind of debates we’ve gotten used to only make it easier for falsehood to survive.";But the whole episode illustrates something depressing: Democratic debate and deliberation were supposed to be how we test ideas, reveal the truth and come to collective decisions.Yet today, “debate” is far more likely to make us dumber than to help us plot a course for the future.When Hotez recently criticized Kennedy again, Rogan offered to give $100,000 to the charity of Hotez’s choice if he would debate Kennedy on Rogan’s show.;2023-06-20T18:53:40+00:00;2023-06-21T10:42:58.529764+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60564;The U.S. needs to launch a diplomatic surge on Ukraine;The Biden administration must up its game in the diplomatic arena.;The Biden administration has done an excellent job of sustaining the effort, in close cooperation with our NATO allies, to supply Ukraine with the materiel, economic aid, intelligence and training it needs to win against the Russian invasion.Now, it’s time to bring our diplomacy up to the same level. We need to launch a diplomatic surge to help Kyiv navigate peace negotiations, rebuild Ukraine and sustain economic pressure on Russia to help win the peace.First, President Biden should appoint a special envoy for peace talks. Right now, we’re being outplayed by the Chinese, who have appointed a top-level diplomat, Li Hui, to represent them on this issue. Li has been meeting with government officials across the region, including in Ukraine, to bolster Beijing’s claims that it supports negotiations. China, however, is not really a disinterested party here — as embodied by Li himself. He has close ties to Kremlin officials, which calls his neutrality as a peacemaker into question.The United States needs to take a more active part in this diplomatic game. An American special envoy should not only shadow Li’s steps in Europe to press U.S. positions, but also travel to countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East to explain why Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war is one of imperialism and colonialism and how it undermines the international system. Understanding the need to show more of a presence on this score, President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing the Ukrainian case any way he can — including an unexpected visit to Saudi Arabia and a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Group of Seven summit in Japan. We should show comparable initiative.Second, Biden should appoint a new ambassador or special coordinator for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Such an official could focus on efforts to transfer the seized assets of the Russian Central Bank to an international Ukrainian development fund. This envoy would also help to promote transparency, private sector engagement and postwar democratic renewal. The job is too big and too political to be handled by existing U.S. agencies.Third, Biden or Secretary of State Antony Blinken should appoint a de facto ambassador to the Russian diaspora. Our current efforts in assisting Russians who emigrated to avoid supporting Putin’s war are inadequate. We have a national security interest in giving these refugees reasons not to return home. Young men who leave Russia today are soldiers who will not be on the battlefield in Ukraine tomorrow. To that end, we should also be working to encourage more emigration.Among other tasks, such an envoy could work on helping Putin critics living in exile to obtain work visas, unblock their bank accounts and maintain their media or civil society work targeting those still inside Russia. Serving as a liaison to the Belarusian opposition could be a part of the job as well. Such positions have been created in the past to interact with diaspora communities from Cuba, Iran and Venezuela.Fourth and finally, Blinken must appoint a new high-profile sanctions coordinator now that James O’Brien — the current coordinator — is moving to another job. Right now, the United States and its allies should be expanding existing sanctions to support ongoing and future Ukrainian counteroffensives — so the sooner we can find a good replacement for O’Brien, the better. Such an envoy would also work on maintaining sanctions after the war until the Kremlin commits to paying reparations. It’s a big, hard job — and it must be filled right away.While helping Ukrainian warriors win the war, the United States also needs to do more to help Kyiv win the peace. The time to gear up for this enormous mission is not after the war ends, but now.;He has close ties to Kremlin officials, which calls his neutrality as a peacemaker into question.The United States needs to take a more active part in this diplomatic game.We should show comparable initiative.Second, Biden should appoint a new ambassador or special coordinator for Ukraine’s reconstruction.Such an envoy would also work on maintaining sanctions after the war until the Kremlin commits to paying reparations.;2023-06-20T16:36:06+00:00;2023-06-21T10:43:29.272880+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60565;Sorry, America. India will never be your ally.;Don't expect India to be an exclusive partner.;"Narendra Modi, once denied a U.S. visa, is now poised to be a showstopper at the White House. The Biden administration is sparing no effort as it prepares to welcome the Indian prime minister later this week at a state dinner, only the third under the current president.As Modi gets set to address Congress for a second time, it might look as if India is pivoting to the United States. But don’t be naive, my dear American friends. India will never be your ally.And this won’t change whether Modi or one of his rivals wins next year’s election. India’s collective memory of the indignities of colonization creates wide public support for an independent path.India’s policy of nonalignment began with a refusal to be entangled in the Cold War. Today this has morphed into aggressive multilateralism. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar says India should benefit “from as many ties as possible.”So if you’re expecting monogamy, prepare to be disappointed. India has reserved the right to flirt with Russia, Iran — and even China — if its national interests dictate such a need.After the 9/11 attacks, Washington asked New Delhi to dispatch troops to Afghanistan. The Indian military vetoed the request. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee withheld military support despite pro-U.S. Indian media urging him to get “on the right side of history” — a phrase often used today in the context of the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Resisting pressure from the George W. Bush administration was a brave move — and, as it turns out, the morally superior one.These days, New Delhi similarly refuses to toe the American line on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India’s import of cheap Russian oil continues to break records. Anyone who wants to see Indian leaders stand up and publicly assail the Kremlin — one of their main suppliers of weaponry and a valuable source of raw materials — is in for a long wait.India has criticized the U.S. decision to block Iranian and Venezuelan oil from the open market. The government in New Delhi has actively worked to bring Iran into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a multilateral forum created by Russia and China in 2001. In May, India hosted the SCO foreign ministers amid border tensions with China and continuing antagonism with Pakistan. A fortnight later, unapologetic about the seeming contradiction, Modi and President Biden were hugging and laughing for the cameras at a meeting of the Quad, a loose security partnership that also includes Australia and Japan.The Post's View: Biden’s challenge: Praise India while cautioning ModiOf course, India’s growing cooperation in the Quad raises hackles in Beijing. And yes, India’s issues with China are grave. Just three years ago, India lost 20 soldiers in a deadly mountain clash with Chinese troops along their common frontier in the high Himalayas.But don’t think for a moment that India will take its cue from America on China; New Delhi wants to manage the relationship on its own terms. Indians have held 18 rounds of talks with the Chinese to resolve the border dispute. Meanwhile, India remains a key participant in the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. As a founding member, India holds the second-largest number of voting shares after China, which at 30 percent effectively enjoys veto rights.There’s no question that the United States and India have much in common. They are both open and argumentative societies. Diversity is the strength of both nations.Even so, it’s not the romance of shared values that is bringing the two countries together. It’s the reality check of geopolitics.India will agree that there is a strategic and urgent need to contain the spread of China, which is already throwing money at smaller countries in South Asia — Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan — to buy influence. China is also flexing its muscles in the Indian Ocean — New Delhi’s strategic backyard — and the broader Indo-Pacific region.But let’s not confuse strategic cooperation for a long-term alliance. In a multipolar world, India will look to be a pole, not an exclusive partner.";India will never be your ally.And this won’t change whether Modi or one of his rivals wins next year’s election.The government in New Delhi has actively worked to bring Iran into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a multilateral forum created by Russia and China in 2001.In May, India hosted the SCO foreign ministers amid border tensions with China and continuing antagonism with Pakistan.;2023-06-20T15:09:41+00:00;2023-06-21T10:43:37.789042+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60567;Trump isn’t the GOP’s biggest problem. Abortion is.;The party is badly out of step with public opinion.;We are fast approaching the first anniversary of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, arguably the most hotly criticized Supreme Court ruling in the 126 years since Plessy v. Ferguson. The 2022 midterms gave us a peek at Dobbs’s possible impact on the national political landscape, saving scores of Democratic Senate and House seats, boosting female voter registration and enabling a clean sweep of pro-abortion-rights ballot measures.In case there was any doubt as to the significance of stripping women of the right to bodily integrity, the Wisconsin Supreme Court race in April turned a normally 50-50 state into a 55.5-44.5 state in favor of Democrats when abortion was front and center.There is every reason to believe that in 2024, the issue will be just as potent and the impact on Republicans up and down the ticket just as disastrous. “A record-high 69% say abortion should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy. The prior high of 67% was recorded last May after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization draft was leaked,” Gallup reports. “Gallup’s oldest trend on the legality of abortion finds 34% of Americans believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances, nearly matching last year’s record-high 35% and above the 27% average since 1975.” Moreover, “another 51% currently say abortion should be legal under certain circumstances, while 13% (similar to the all-time low of 12%) want it illegal in all circumstances.”Many Republican candidates (for Congress, state legislatures and the 2024 presidential nomination) have vigorously pushed for a nationwide ban on abortion. That’s a dead-bang loser for the party. According to a new USA Today-Suffolk University poll, “Americans overwhelmingly oppose the next goal of many anti-abortion activists, to enact a federal law banning abortion nationwide. By 80%-14%, those surveyed opposed that idea, including 65% of Republicans and 83% of independents.”Moreover, it’s not so easy for Republicans to drop a stance that 80 percent of the general electorate opposes. Forced-birth advocates have made clear they will not support candidates who shrink from the post radical antiabortion stance. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America blasted former president Donald Trump when he appeared to deviate from the most extreme position. The group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, issued a statement declaring: “Holding to the position that it is exclusively up to the states is an abdication of responsibility by anyone elected to federal office.”Republicans have shown no ability to restrain their most militant antiabortion voices. In state after state, they have passed a slew of draconian forced-birth laws that have resulted in near-deaths, trauma and hardship for women. Republicans thereby have locked themselves into a stance that simultaneously generates extreme opposition while producing nonstop stories demonstrating the cruel and dangerous results of their policies. In doing so, they’ve made their unpopular stance a critical issue in every state.Ironically, Trump’s failed attempt to nudge the party toward a less damaging position serves as a warning to other candidates, who are now racing to outdo one another in fidelity to the forced-birth crowd. Former vice president Mike Pence, for example, has chastised Trump for wobbling on the issue. (“I believe that the cause of life has been the animating core of our movement for 50 years, and that the American people and Republicans long to see leadership that remains dedicated to the principle of restoring the sanctity of life to the center of American law.”)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in an interview with the Messenger, knocked Trump for criticizing the six-week ban DeSantis signed into law. “He said it was ‘harsh’ to protect an unborn child when there’s a detectable heartbeat. I think that’s humane to do.” De Santis pronounced himself “surprised” that Trump would deviate from antiabortion orthodoxy.Conventional wisdom suggests that Trump poses the biggest threat to Republicans’ 2024 prospects. Certainly, nominating a candidate who 60 percent of the country thinks has committed serious crimes might spell doom for the top of the ticket and therefore every down-ticket Republican. However, Republicans might eventually shed their attachment to Trump, recognizing the political implications of lining up behind someone facing criminal prosecution in multiple jurisdictions. But shedding their attachment to the most extreme and most unpopular abortion position might prove far more difficult.Democrats, who smartly leaned into the abortion issue in the midterms, understand all too well the Republicans’ self-inflicted wound. If they can push swing states such as Wisconsin even a few points (let alone 10) in their direction, the 2024 election could mark the beginning of a permanent sea change in American politics. If so, Republicans will have only themselves to blame.;The prior high of 67% was recorded last May after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization draft was leaked,” Gallup reports.According to a new USA Today-Suffolk University poll, “Americans overwhelmingly oppose the next goal of many anti-abortion activists, to enact a federal law banning abortion nationwide.However, Republicans might eventually shed their attachment to Trump, recognizing the political implications of lining up behind someone facing criminal prosecution in multiple jurisdictions.;2023-06-20T11:45:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:43:57.914407+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60568;Who will drop out of the GOP primary first? Here are some clues.;Republican primary candidates Trump, DeSantis, Haley, Scott, Burgum and Ramaswamy have different odds of dropping out. Here's who you should watch.;Now that nearly every major Republican has either begun their presidential campaign or bowed out, the “testing the waters” phase of the 2024 Republican primary is over. Next up: dropout season.Between now and the Iowa caucuses in January, candidates must raise funds, build voter bases and stand up professional campaigns — or risk being forced out of the race. It’s impossible to say which candidate will exit first. But a quick tour through the data provides three insights about what could happen.Most candidates who drop out before the Iowa caucuses are obvious long shots: They’re forgettable backbenchers seeking fame or has-beens attempting to relive their glory days. Typically, these campaigns begin with little fanfare, generate minimal support and end quickly.But, in most primaries, at least one seemingly strong candidate fails early. In the 2020 Democratic primary, it was then-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). In 2016, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) famously flopped against Donald Trump. And, early in the 2012 campaign, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty — a supposed alternative to Mitt Romney — left the race after just four months.Oftentimes, journalists are at fault. In some ways, they function as voters’ talent scouts, and they often overhype uncharismatic contenders. In other cases, the candidate is to blame for their own loss. Harris, for instance, briefly broke out as a top candidate in the 2020 race, but she failed to find a unique message, slid in the polls and ran out of money.This pattern should be sobering for Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), former vice president Mike Pence, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and maybe even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Each of them might look great on paper, but if historical patterns hold, at least one of them will prove to be in over their head and fizzle sooner than anyone expects.The least serious candidates might be the most likely to make it to Iowa. To see why, compare the 2020 candidacies of Harris and businessman Andrew Yang.In the first three quarters of 2020, Harris raised much more money than Yang:Yet Yang outlasted the future vice president, and even nearly matched her polling figures at the end of her campaign:The reason: Harris’s donors wanted her to be president, but Yang’s just wanted him to be. When Harris’s path to the nomination disappeared, donors noticed and cut her off. Yang, by contrast, never had a viable route to the presidency. His supporters loved his fun, nerdy presence and his willingness to non-mainstream policies such as universal basic income.The lesson for 2024: Don’t underestimate the longevity of Vivek Ramaswamy or any other candidate using the race as an exercise in personal branding.No candidate at the lower end of the polls will say so, but their decision to stay in the race will hinge on how Trump and DeSantis fare in the next three to six months.Trump has around 52 percent in national primary polls, and DeSantis has around 22 percent. Together, that’s almost three-quarters of the overall GOP electorate. If Trump and DeSantis keep hogging that much of the vote, there will be little space for anyone else to make a plausible run. The field — which now features 11 candidates — will contract.This basic dynamic has shown up in other presidential primaries. When the top two candidates dominate poll numbers — as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama did in the 2008 Democratic primary, and Clinton and Bernie Sanders did in 2016 — the field clears. But when the leading candidates show some initial weakness, others try their luck.Expect similar developments this year: If GOP primary voters clearly communicate that they want Trump or DeSantis — and nobody else — expect the field to drop to two, or maybe three, candidates.But if Trump or DeSantis starts to bleed support — perhaps Trump’s indictments prove too much to overcome or DeSantis’s standing in the polls continue to deteriorate — other candidates will see themselves as the next up-and-comer. The race would then start to look like 2012 or 2016: Long-shot candidates will stay past their expiry, and the party will settle in for a grueling battle.;Typically, these campaigns begin with little fanfare, generate minimal support and end quickly.But, in most primaries, at least one seemingly strong candidate fails early.If Trump and DeSantis keep hogging that much of the vote, there will be little space for anyone else to make a plausible run.The race would then start to look like 2012 or 2016: Long-shot candidates will stay past their expiry, and the party will settle in for a grueling battle.;2023-06-20T11:15:48+00:00;2023-06-21T10:44:07.515814+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60569;Can an unbiased cable news channel succeed? Not while Trump is around.;When it comes to politics, Trump is every news organization's center of gravity.;In recent days, Fox News viewers have repeatedly been told that the federal indictment of former president Donald Trump is another witch hunt perpetrated by a deep-state cabal to protect a corrupt establishment.Meanwhile, tuning in to MSNBC will largely lead viewers to the conclusion that Trump represents a long-standing threat to democracy finally facing a day of reckoning thanks to a fearless prosecutor upholding the principle that no one is above the law.It’s the latest example of the predictable narratives that emanate daily from the cable news leaders — and it’s the kind of coverage that prompted recently ousted CNN chief executive Chris Licht to attempt to rebrand his network as a source of detached and balanced reporting that followed the facts and encouraged viewers to make up their own minds.As we all know now, Licht’s efforts didn’t work. Viewers accustomed to what CNN had become in recent years deserted, while the staff rebelled. But that doesn’t mean Licht’s vision was wrong. It just means that an unbiased news channel, in this deeply polarized moment, can’t compete for eyeballs with competitors that cater to partisan passions.Just before Licht’s ouster, The Post reported, “Many journalists at the network still compare Licht, unfavorably, to former CNN president Jeff Zucker, who fostered loyalty from his staff by giving them more opportunities, generous contracts and leeway to express their personal sentiments about the news.”Perry Bacon Jr.: CNN’s Chris Licht showed the problem with anti-woke centrismThat last point is key. CNN, the granddaddy of cable news, had once been the unchallenged champion of 24-hour information. But then along came Fox, with point-of-view hosts catering to conservative sensibilities. Witnessing Fox’s ratings climb, MSNBC eventually embraced the same strategy, targeting the opposite end of the political spectrum. To compete, CNN had to choose a lane, ultimately becoming something akin to MSNBC Light — an identity to which it will almost certainly revert to appease its staff and its viewers.That’s the world that we — and Licht — live in now, and we ought to acknowledge it. Especially since Trump’s rise, the cable news leaders pay lip service to journalism and employ just enough legitimate reporters to justify the claim. But their provocateurs drive the ratings. Critics often label Fox News as entertainment, not news. But MSNBC and CNN have been just as bad.Jennifer Rubin: CNN needs a new chief. Here’s the ideal candidate.While Fox (along with several of its hosts, including the since-departed Tucker Carlson) was guilty of pandering to Trump loyalists by perpetuating his disproven theories of a stolen 2020 election — and ended up paying a heavy financial and reputational price for that — MSNBC and CNN shamelessly trafficked in an unrelenting stream of partisan attacks during Trump’s presidency, particularly regarding “Russian collusion.” But people watched. As Licht discovered — and smaller competitors such as NewsNation know — there’s a comparatively modest cable audience for straight reporting.Any examination of today’s news media has to start with their approach to covering Trump, and the differences among them are nowhere so starkly delineated as within the cable news universe.Licht’s ouster provided the perfect object lesson. It was precipitated by CNN’s Trump town hall, which was condemned for “platforming” the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. But what really seemed to upset the critics was that Trump is too good at what he does. He controls live television events more effectively than any other politician. And because of his endless lies, the theory goes, he cannot be trusted to address the American people unfiltered.Erik Wemple: Chris Licht is out, and so is CNN’s centrist follyTrump tells some whoppers, most notably that fraud cost him reelection. In fact, during Trump’s presidency, The Post famously documented 30,573 prevarications, differentiating between outright lies and more nuanced “misleading claims,” the latter of which, to be fair, were often consistent with the spin heard from most presidents. Since no one has kept a detailed “lie count” for other commanders in chief, we’ll never have a precise comparison.Nevertheless, the trope of Trump as liar extraordinaire has provided some cable news types with an argument to aggressively challenge him — even argue with him — rather than merely interview him. In truth, Americans are smart enough to sniff out lies if they’re interested in independent thinking. If they’re not, no level of real-time fact-checking will persuade them. But in today’s cable news landscape, reporters are expected to serve as avatars for their respective partisan audiences.When Trump is someday gone from the scene, it’s conceivable that cable’s hyperpartisan fever might break. Until then, there are TV options for those willing to limit their news diet to something less than round-the-clock alarmism. Revisit the traditional nightly newscasts on NBC, ABC and CBS, along with “PBS NewsHour” (where I sometimes get to join the conversation).

60570;How many dead moms will it take to stop America’s maternal mortality epidemic?;Women need equitable access to visits, drugs, devices and insurance coverage before, during and after childbirth.;When sheriff’s deputies in Florida went to perform a welfare check last month on Tori Bowie, the Olympic runner, they made the saddest possible discovery. Bowie and her newborn daughter were dead. Though the full story of Bowie’s last days has yet to emerge, some details are clear: She had died in labor, suffering from eclampsia and respiratory distress.These tragic events are an enraging reminder that the United States’ maternal mortality rate is the worst in the industrialized world. Black women are up to three times more likely to die during or after pregnancy than White women. Almost two-thirds of all these deaths could be prevented.Expectant moms deserve more from their lawmakers, providers, public health groups and hospitals: more visits before and after pregnancy, better access to the simple drugs and devices that could keep them alive, and expanded insurance coverage.Since the federal government began keeping records in 1987, America’s maternal mortality rate has only gotten worse. Between 2000 and 2020, the United States was one of eight countries where the situation deteriorated fastest, a list that included Venezuela and Mauritius. There’s no one cause of this long slide: A strained health-care system, a stingy insurance system, a lack of paid leave, the retreat of reproductive rights and endemic racism all contribute.Covid-19 made a bad situation worse. Pregnant women who contracted the virus were seven times more likely to die than those who avoided infection. But even as vaccination became widespread, pregnant women kept dying from all the more common causes: infections, hemorrhages, hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia and embolisms. In 2022, 733 American women died while pregnant or shortly after childbirth. That’s a maternal death rate of 20 per 100,000 births — up from 17.6 in 2019, already two or three times the rate of many high-income nations.For Black women, pregnancy and childbirth bring the toll of racism in the United States into sharp focus. A large body of research shows that being Black in America wears on women’s bodies, leaving them uniquely vulnerable during pregnancy. Black women are 60 percent more likely than White women to experience preeclampsia, for instance. Add to which they experience inequalities in access, quality of care, prescribing, data collection and more. These differences persist even among wealthy, educated women. So stark is the disparity it has come under United Nations scrutiny.There’s much providers can do to help: A 2019 analysis of preventable maternal deaths by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gives a clear list. Open earlier or stay open later to serve patients who work nights. Accept Medicaid. Educate patients early and often about conditions to watch out for. Take patients with headaches or shortness of breath seriously.And there’s a lot policymakers must do to keep pregnant women safe and healthy. Fortunately, even in this divided, fractious Congress, there’s bipartisan support. Bills introduced by Reps. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), Robin L. Kelly (D-Ill.) and Robert E. Latta (R-Ohio) and Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Maggie Hassan Wood (D-N.H.) would pull together working groups to identify the best ways forward. One target of Kelly and Latta’s: Finding ways to identify and improve hospitals and doctors who are failing women and babies.Lawmakers in both parties agree that childbirth and postpartum support from other practitioners matters, too. Evidence is accumulating that access to doula care during labor can lower Caesarean section rates. Doulas offer mothers nonmedical support and advocacy before, during and after delivery. Programs run both by community groups and insurance giants are exploring whether doulas can have a measurable impact on maternal mortality, especially for Black women.Congress funded some home health visiting programs in the 2022 government appropriations bill. The United States should join other wealthy countries in making sure new mothers get regular visits after they come home from the hospital, when they are still at risk.It would also help to standardize how Medicaid covers the medicines and devices for pregnant people. An analysis by KFF found glaring gaps. Four state Medicaid programs still don’t cover low-dose aspirin, which can prevent preeclampsia. Ten don’t cover blood pressure monitors for use at home between doctor’s visits. And six states don’t cover glucose monitors, crucial for managing gestational diabetes.Meanwhile, the federal government could kick-start pilot programs that explore new ways to lower maternal mortality. Examples include payment schemes that compensate providers who do a better job for mothers and babies or demonstration projects that bundle housing and prenatal care in the same setting.We don’t know whether Tori Bowie and her baby could have been saved with earlier intervention. We do know how to save hundreds of other American mothers.;Black women are up to three times more likely to die during or after pregnancy than White women.Black women are 60 percent more likely than White women to experience preeclampsia, for instance.And six states don’t cover glucose monitors, crucial for managing gestational diabetes.Meanwhile, the federal government could kick-start pilot programs that explore new ways to lower maternal mortality.;2023-06-20T10:30:36+00:00;2023-06-21T10:44:26.931523+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60571;How to take Congress away from the crazies;House Speaker Kevin McCarthy can work with pragmatists and moderates of both parties to get things done.;Kevin McCarthy has a choice to make.The Republican House speaker from California can spend the next 18 months groveling before a dozen or so right-wing zealots — indulging their partisan fantasies of “owning the libs,” taking down the president and the Justice Department, and using the threat of government shutdown to impose radical policies on a country that doesn’t want them.Or, as he did with the bipartisan debt ceiling deal he negotiated with a Democratic president, McCarthy can work with pragmatists and moderates of both parties to get some modest things done in a way that helps the country and improves Republican prospects in the 2024 election.The glad-handing McCarthy continues to hope against hope that he can somehow avoid this painful choice. But as his two GOP predecessors discovered before leaving in frustration, his majority is too slim, his caucus too divided — and the renegades far too demanding — for that to work. That way lies another failed speakership.Pragmatists and moderates of both parties have a tough choice to make, too. Say what you will about the members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus — and certainly there is plenty to criticize — there is no denying they are focused and engaged and willing to take heat for the things they really care about. Centrists and pragmatists must learn to be just as determined and muscular.That’s my beef with the moderates of both parties. They complain about how extremists have pushed their caucuses too far to the left or the right. But faced with opportunities to force things back into the center, they flinch, unwilling to face criticism from caucus colleagues and the partisan hordes on social media.So here’s the deal, as President Biden would say: If moderates and pragmatists of both parties want to marginalize the extremes once and for all — if they are really serious about governing and bipartisan compromise — then they need to set aside the partisan norms by which the House has always operated, and give the speaker a different way of doing business.Now, bear with me through a brief romp into the parliamentary weeds.Speakers control the House through rules — not the impenetrable “Rules of the House” that are adopted at the beginning of each two-year session, but temporary “rules” that allow the House to move immediately to the next piece of legislation, setting how long the debate will be and who can offer which amendments. In recent years, as the House has become increasingly partisan, that debate has been brief and amendments few. The effect has been to shut out members of the minority party — roughly half the House — from participation in the legislative process.Temporary rules are crafted by the House Rules Committee, most of whose members are beholden to the speaker. And because these rules provide the parliamentary mechanism by which the speaker and the majority party control the legislative agenda, members of the majority party are expected to always vote in favor of rules — whether or not they intend to vote for the underlying bill — while members of the minority are expected to vote no as told by the party brass.That norm was set aside two weeks ago, when the right-wing zealots voted against the debt ceiling rule and several dozen moderate Democrats voted in favor. Resentful that they had been outmaneuvered, extremists took revenge on the speaker by subsequently voting against the rule by which the House would have moved on to its next order of business.I think we can all agree it’s crazy to allow the uncompromising extremists in Congress to dictate policy to everyone else. So here’s a deal that Democratic moderates could offer McCarthy to sideline the Republican renegades. On legislation with a serious chance of passage (and these days, there aren’t many), Democrats can provide the necessary votes to pass the “rule” — but only if moderates from both parties can offer a reasonable number of germane amendments. That won’t guarantee bipartisan compromise, but it would become possible.A similar arrangement in the Senate could restore a modicum of majority rule to that dysfunctional chamber. A gang of 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats is enough to strike a bargain to end filibusters and “holds” on bills and nominations with significant bipartisan support. That would undermine the current practice of the minority party filibustering virtually everything. And it would put an end to showboat senators log-jamming nominations, as Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) has done recently with military promotions and Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) has threatened to do with Justice Department nominations.These modest steps, easily within the power of moderates and pragmatists, would neutralize extremists, break through the partisan gridlock and jump-start bipartisan compromise to solve some of the big issues facing the country.It is easy — too easy — to blame the zealots for hijacking the legislative process. The only reason the hijackers succeed is because party leaders and the quiescent majority of reasonable lawmakers won’t muster the courage and imagination to stop them.;In recent years, as the House has become increasingly partisan, that debate has been brief and amendments few.So here’s a deal that Democratic moderates could offer McCarthy to sideline the Republican renegades.That won’t guarantee bipartisan compromise, but it would become possible.A similar arrangement in the Senate could restore a modicum of majority rule to that dysfunctional chamber.;2023-06-20T10:15:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:44:36.525710+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60572;How to make Social Security more progressive and more conservative;We can make the government better at serving its broadly supported goals and cheaper at the same time.;Republicans have a more working-class coalition than they did a generation ago. As that reality has dawned on them, they have become more willing to chuck aside old party orthodoxies such as support for free trade. They should change their fiscal agenda, too — by taking on the challenge of making Social Security and Medicaid, two of the largest federal programs, more progressive.Both programs are already designed to transfer wealth downward, from the rich to the middle class and from the middle class to poor Americans. But political considerations have kept them from meeting this objective as efficiently as possible. To keep broad popular support, Social Security directs many benefits to the middle class and even to the affluent. Because it was necessary to win the votes of Southern Democrats in the 1960s, Medicaid is administered by state governments though largely funded at the federal level.Unwinding those political deals would make it possible for both programs to become simultaneously better for poor Americans and less expensive. Social Security should be reformed so a larger proportion of its benefits go to the senior citizens who need them most, and Medicaid funds should no longer be disproportionately directed to the richest states.Social Security has a maximum tax: This year, it applies only to income up to $160,000. It also has a maximum benefit: Retire this year at age 67, and your annual benefit will be capped at a bit more than $42,000. By law, both of those numbers rise automatically over time.Democrats generally want to make the program more progressive, and cut its funding shortfall, by raising or eliminating the tax cap. Andrew Biggs, a colleague of mine at the American Enterprise Institute and a nominee for the Social Security Advisory Board, points out that Congress could address the shortfall from the opposite direction. Just capping the maximum benefit at today’s level — letting it keep up with inflation but not rise any faster — would, he tells me, solve a quarter of the problem. The people who would see their future benefit levels change would be the very Americans in the best position to save for their own retirements. Benefits would continue to rise for typical retirees.The Post's View: Social Security needs fixing. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be painful.A bolder plan would freeze benefits more broadly so middle-class retirees in the future got checks with the same inflation-adjusted value as today’s middle-class retirees. The bigger the savings, the more room there would be for another progressive change to the program: raising its minimum benefit so it serves as a guarantee against poverty.Where Social Security could be improved by changing its benefit formula, Medicaid needs an overhaul of its basic federal-state structure. States get more federal money the more they spend. This has several bad effects. Affluent states can afford to spend more, so they get a disproportionate share of federal dollars. And though the structure is supposed to strengthen states, it also sets them up for budget crises. During boom times, state officials can expand Medicaid for their own voters while knowing taxpayers in the rest of the country will foot most of the bill. (The feds offered an even better deal for states to expand the program as part of the Affordable Care Act, which explains why most of them took it and the holdouts have been folding one by one.) When there’s a bust, cutting those benefits back is a losing proposition. The officials have to inflict more than $2 of pain on the state’s voters to save $1 for state budgets.Catherine Rampell: Government incompetence is knocking eligible Americans off MedicaidFederal funding also distorts state budget decisions in another way: It makes spending an extra dollar on Medicaid more attractive to state policymakers than, say, spending more on education. Even if much of the Medicaid expansion just takes the place of private health insurance, the state will still come out ahead with federal dollars. And states have proved adept at gaming the system, padding their costs to get more from the treasury.The latest proposal for a less perverse funding structure for the program comes from Chris Pope of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. He would have the federal government directly fund all of the Medicaid benefits it mandates, give states a capped allotment for long-term care and let them raise and spend their own funds on any additional benefits. Much less of the program’s spending would involve one level of government paying for decisions made at another level.To pursue this change to Medicaid, though, Republicans would have to get over the bad habit of confusing the current funding arrangement with the federalism they revere. They now have a partisan interest in reform they did not before: It would mean that fewer federal dollars went to blue states and more to red states.To make either Medicaid or Social Security more progressive, Republicans would also have to overcome their instinctive belief that “redistribution” is the worst thing about the welfare state. These reforms would make these programs more effective at taking from higher earners and giving to lower earners and thus make the government more redistributive.If that makes the government better at serving its broadly supported goals and cheaper at the same time, that ought to be fine. Entitlement reform can be progressive and conservative, too, if we want it to be.;To keep broad popular support, Social Security directs many benefits to the middle class and even to the affluent.The people who would see their future benefit levels change would be the very Americans in the best position to save for their own retirements.Benefits would continue to rise for typical retirees.The Post's View: Social Security needs fixing.;2023-06-20T10:00:13+00:00;2023-06-21T10:44:46.084687+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60573;Biden shouldn’t be as unpopular as Trump — but he is;A nation that regards Biden and Trump as similarly flawed politicians is one that is going to wind up with more Trump-style leaders.;Throughout Donald Trump’s tenure in office, polls showed he was one of the most unpopular presidents in recent history. That made sense — Trump was bad at governing and seemed almost as if he were trying to be disliked. But for almost two years now, Joe Biden has been just as unpopular as Trump was, and at times even more so. That’s not necessarily bad for the Democrats. But it’s bad for democracy.The numbers behind Biden’s unpopularity are easy to understand. Like Trump, he has almost universal support within his own party, virtually none from the opposite party and terrible numbers among independents. Biden’s approval with Democrats is 84 percent, according to Gallup polling, similar to Trump’s 87 percent from Republicans midway through this third year in office. Biden is at 33 percent approval among independents, same as Trump in May 2019. (In contrast, Bill Clinton was at 56 percent with independents halfway through his third year, George W. Bush at 62, Barack Obama at 46. Bush’s numbers were very high in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.)Biden has a 4 percent approval rating among Republicans. That’s much worse than Clinton (20 percent) and Obama (16 percent) but not unlike Trump’s 8 percent among Democrats.What’s harder to understand is why Biden is so unpopular. There are some obvious reasons that he is not loved. Inflation is unusually high. Negative partisanship has grown substantially since Clinton’s tenure — it’s not clear any president could have 20 percent approval from people in the opposite party. The president’s centrist, bipartisan approach likely ensures a bloc of younger and more progressive Democrats won’t be thrilled with him. Voters in Britain, Canada, France and numerous other countries are also dissatisfied with their leaders, according to polls, so perhaps it’s almost impossible to be a popular politician in 2023.Finally, even though Biden defeated Trump and Hillary Clinton didn’t, Biden is in many ways similar to Clinton, who was also never very popular. Both are skilled at behind-the-scenes governing and appealing to older stalwart Democratic voters on the campaign trail but struggle to connect with younger and less engaged voters.But I’m not sure that all adds up to Biden being as unpopular as Trump. The president is not perfect. But he has hired competent advisers, successfully managed crises such as the potential debt default, enacted legislation that polls well with the public, reached deals with the opposite party, made smart decisions on foreign policy, and acted with dignity and grace.It’s striking that Biden, who makes a great effort to reach out to Republicans — both lawmakers and voters — is so hated by them, significantly more than Obama was. Fox News and other factors driving partisan polarization existed during Obama’s presidency. And unlike Trump, Biden does not talk or make policy as if he were president of only half the country. (Biden, of course, sometimes is quite partisan and harsh. Two years ago, he, appropriately in my view, likened a Georgia voting law to “Jim Crow 2.0,” infuriating conservatives so much that they still regularly complain about this remark.)Nor is it obvious why independents aren’t responding favorably to Biden’s numerous bipartisan deals. After all, some governors are quite popular. And they tend to be Biden-ish moderates, such as Republican Phil Scott of Vermont (81 percent approval according to Morning Consult) and Democrat Andy Beshear of Kentucky (60 percent).If I told you in June 2020 that in June 2023 businesses would be totally reopened as if the pandemic had never happened, that unemployment would be low, Black unemployment its lowest-ever, and that major climate change and infrastructure laws had passed, I think you would have been very surprised to learn that Biden’s approval ratings would be virtually the same as Trump’s.You might argue approval ratings don’t matter. And in some important ways, they don’t. Biden has been able to get a lot of legislation enacted. The Democrats did better in last November’s midterm elections than any party in control of the White House since 2002. And Biden will be the clear favorite if Trump wins the GOP nomination, as seems likely right now.But Biden’s dismal numbers are worrisome for four reasons. First and most important, the United States desperately needs models of effective leadership that can be emulated. We are in a time of deep distrust of leaders and institutions, from the government to the police to churches. I don’t agree with everything the president does, but if we had more people in charge mirroring Biden’s calm, optimistic, inclusive style, the country would be much better off.But other leaders in our society aren’t going to emulate Biden as long as we keep getting weekly data (the approval ratings) suggesting most Americans don’t like him. We have data on presidential approval stretching back decades. It’s an objective, long-standing measure of how Americans view their leaders. So far, the lesson of the past seven years is whether you send hateful tweets every day or try to be conciliatory almost all of the time, 40 percent of Americans will like you and the rest won’t. That’s not good.Second, Biden’s unpopularity makes it hard to figure out exactly what Americans are looking for in terms of policy. I would prefer a more left-leaning president, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) But I assumed someone with a more centrist vision would at least be more popular with voters than those two progressives or a fairly right-wing conservative like Trump. Watching Biden focus on noncontroversial economic policies such as increasing infrastructure spending and still be unpopular suggests there is no clear policy model to appeal to a wide bloc of voters.Democratic candidates did well in last year’s elections by keeping their distance from Biden and his agenda while attacking Republican candidates for being too conservative. Those were effective political tactics, but they didn’t give those who were elected a clear policy mandate from the public.Third, it’s hard for a president to lead the country if he is so unpopular. If Biden’s poll numbers were reversed (55 percent approval, 41 percent disapproval), I suspect congressional Republicans would have been less eager to create a debt ceiling crisis. And even if they adopted that posture, business leaders, the news media and other institutions would have been more willing to embrace Biden’s position instead of trying to stay neutral. Back in the 1990s, Clinton’s high approval numbers were regularly invoked as an indication that voters did not want him removed from office because of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.This question of leadership would become even more important if there were a national crisis. In 2020, it was probably good the president was unpopular and people were used to ignoring him, because Trump was giving inaccurate medical advice in the middle of a deadly pandemic. But when states battled one another over protective gear back then, they showed the problem with having no real national leadership. I would hope in a crisis today that governors and others would take cues from Biden, who would lead in a mature way. But presidents with 40 percent approval ratings tend to be opposed or ignored.Finally, Biden being so unpopular means that Democrats could lose the presidency to an antidemocratic candidate such as Trump or Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Biden would be the favorite against either, but narrowly. He is effectively tied in polls against both. Democrats didn’t do that well last November — they lost the popular vote in the House for the first time since 2016. Biden’s unpopularity is a key driver of the Democrats’ unsteady electoral standing.Biden has been the kind of president that I thought Americans wanted. But voters aren’t really rewarding him for that. That’s disappointing. A nation that regards Biden and Trump as similarly flawed politicians is one that is going to wind up with more Trump-style leaders who are cruel and corrupt — and not good at governing either.;Biden’s approval with Democrats is 84 percent, according to Gallup polling, similar to Trump’s 87 percent from Republicans midway through this third year in office.That’s much worse than Clinton (20 percent) and Obama (16 percent) but not unlike Trump’s 8 percent among Democrats.What’s harder to understand is why Biden is so unpopular.If Biden’s poll numbers were reversed (55 percent approval, 41 percent disapproval), I suspect congressional Republicans would have been less eager to create a debt ceiling crisis.;2023-06-20T09:45:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:44:55.657891+00:00;637;Opinions;3549;The Reading Must
60586;"Biden calls Xi a dictator; Beijing slams remark as ‘provocation’";President Biden's remarks came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to soothe tensions while meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing.;China called President Biden’s suggestion that its leader is a dictator “extremely absurd and irresponsible,” potentially undoing the hard-won efforts to calm tensions between the two superpowers.Biden’s comments came barely a day after Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Xi Jinping in Beijing, forging a tentative way past the tensions that have bedeviled relations since a Chinese spy balloon floated across the United States in February.Biden referred to Xi as a dictator while explaining how he had been embarrassed by the spy balloon because he was unaware it had gone off course.“The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is he didn’t know it was there,” Biden said. “That’s what’s a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn’t know what happened.”Blinken holds ‘candid’ talks with China’s Xi amid effort to ease tensionsThe downing of the balloon in February further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, which were already at odds over economic and military issues. But following his marathon meetings in Beijing this week, Blinken said that the Biden administration considered the matter of the balloon closed.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said at a briefing Wednesday that China considered Biden’s statements “an open political provocation” to which “China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed.”“The remarks made by the U.S. are extremely absurd and irresponsible,” she said. “They are a serious violation of basic facts, diplomatic etiquette and China’s political dignity.”Mao said the spy balloon episode had been an accident. The United States “should have handled the incident in a calm, rational and professional manner,” she said. Instead, Washington “distorted the facts” and “hyped up the incident.”John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, said Biden’s remark could “imperil the diplomatic initiative.”While Blinken’s mission did not result in tangible agreements or declarations, the “substance was the diplomacy,” Delury said. “It was meeting and being respectful and cordial and sitting down face to face.”Such an inflammatory remark so soon after the visit, Delury said, “does jeopardize some of what was done.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment seeking clarification on Biden’s remark. He is known for gaffes, and it was not immediately clear if the White House would attempt to walk back his comments, as it has done before.The White House keeps walking back Biden’s remarksBiden has mused about Xi’s style of power before. At a fundraising event last year — which was held at a private home, just as Tuesday’s event was — Biden said that the Chinese leader “doesn’t have a democratic — with a small ‘d’ — bone in his body.”Biden said at the event in April 2022 said that Xi “doesn’t think that democracies can be sustained in the 21st century, in the second quarter of the century, because things are moving so rapidly, so incredibly fast that only — he doesn’t say ‘autocracy’ — only autocracies are able to handle it,” adding that Xi had been “very straightforward with me” and that the pair had discussed the matter of democracy before.Biden and Xi met last November on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, where Biden said there would be no “new Cold War,” and that it was important for the two countries to “be able to work together” on solving global issues such as climate change and food insecurity. Xi said in remarks before their meeting that “the world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship,” noting that the meeting had “attracted the world’s attention.”How the U.S. improvised a plan to deal with a Chinese balloonMany democracies have been increasingly concerned by Xi’s increasingly authoritarian tendencies, but few world leaders have blatantly used the D-word.In October, Xi consolidated his power to a degree not seen in decades when he secured a third term as general secretary and head of the Central Military Commission, the Chinese Communist Party’s two most important positions.Since first claiming the role of China’s top leader in 2012, Xi has increasingly elevated his personal status within the party. He did away with presidential term limits in 2018, paving the way for a third term and defying unspoken rules that had been instated by previous Chinese leaders in the hopes of preventing one-man rule.Under Xi’s leadership, China has seen an expansion of mass surveillance and crackdowns on civil society, a campaign of mass detention in the western Xinjiang region, as well as a harsh security clampdown in Hong Kong and military aggression in the Taiwan Strait.Vic Chiang contributed to this report.;“They are a serious violation of basic facts, diplomatic etiquette and China’s political dignity.”Mao said the spy balloon episode had been an accident.The United States “should have handled the incident in a calm, rational and professional manner,” she said.;2023-06-21T09:01:07+00:00;2023-06-21T10:47:01.035808+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60587;The complicated relationship between a presidential father and a struggling son;Hunter Biden’s plea deal on tax and gun charges underscores the complexities of his bond with President Biden.;Joe Biden, when news broke years ago that his son Hunter had been discharged from the Navy Reserve because of cocaine use, responded with a quick message to his family.“Good as it could be,” he wrote, in an email verified by The Washington Post. “Time to move on. Love Dad.”Nearly a decade later, his son again is attempting to move on.Hunter Biden on Tuesday agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax crimes and admit to the facts on a felony gun charge — terms that would probably keep him out of jail and could conclude a years-long criminal probe.If a judge signs off on the deal, it may not dampen the potential political peril, but it could bring closure to a long-running legal saga that has thrust to the forefront a complex relationship between a presidential father and a son recovering from addiction. It is one in which a son acknowledged the vast benefits that have come with his famous father’s last name — while also at times believing that if he were named Hunter Smith, he wouldn’t be targeted the way he has been.Those close to Hunter say he views this as part of the process for any addict: admitting to past mistakes and seeking to make amends for them. They point out that the charges focus on a narrower slice than investigators initially launched on — and as Republicans have accused him of. They have little to do with his foreign business deals — in Ukraine and China — and involve his own poor decisions rather than anything that might be tied to his father.The tax charges are fairly minor, resulting in misdemeanors for two years of failing to pay taxes — a bill that his attorneys have said he has since paid. And the gun charge is related to him lying on a gun form and using drugs at the time of a gun purchase — something that he essentially admitted in his memoir.Biden allies view it as part of a rehabilitation, of his life and of his public image. He has often been a third rail for the White House, with staffers uneasy about talking with the president about Hunter. Some of those close to Hunter view this as the next step in a process where he can be more of a public presence in his father’s presidency and reelection effort, returning him to a role he had long played as something of an informal adviser in his father’s political career.During Biden’s 2008 presidential campaign, Hunter and his brother would travel together in Iowa on what was dubbed by the campaign as the “Here Come the Bidens!” tour. In the 2020 presidential campaign launch in Philadelphia, Hunter’s seat sat empty.“The President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life,” Ian Sams, a White House spokesman, said in a statement on Monday. “We will have no further comment.”Biden, who was at an event in California on Tuesday, did not respond to several questions about the agreement, saying only, “I’m very proud of my son.”White House aides have emphasized that Biden had no role in the Justice Department investigation into his son. The Donald Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, was left in place to continue the investigation.The history of troubled presidential children is extraordinarily long, often the result of struggles to live up to lofty expectations amid the glare of public attention.Andrew Johnson’s oldest son died after being thrown off a horse, his middle son was an alcoholic who died by suicide, and his youngest suffered from tuberculosis, drank to excess and died at age 26. Andrew Jackson’s son died in a hunting accident. John Tyler and John Quincy Adams each had sons who were alcoholics and died young.Franklin D. Roosevelt had five adult children with 19 marriages between them, with one son becoming the center of a national scandal for using his father to obtain lucrative contracts.By most accounts, Hunter Biden’s life is on far more stable ground than it was four years ago. He has remarried and has a young son, named after his late brother Beau. He was at the White House to walk his daughter Naomi down the aisle at her wedding in November, and he has been a more visible presence next to his father during public events.But he also lives in constant fear that his battle with addiction will resurface. He lives, he has said, with “a healthy fear of relapse,” and with the realization that he is one bad choice away from spiraling.“I’m concerned. I really am. In the sense of, I have a healthy fear,” Hunter Biden said in 2021 at the end of a 90-minute discussion with Marc Maron on his “WTF” podcast. “I’m not living in that. But you know, I’m leaving here and I’m going straight home.”In Hunter’s own accounts, Joe Biden is the figure offering unconditional love to a son. He’s a father who is often attempting — and, as many family members of addicts, frequently failing — to help his son through a life overwhelmed by alcohol and drugs.He checks in with him daily, making phone calls, and, when they go unanswered, texts.While Joe Biden is a teetotaler, Hunter’s first sip of alcohol came as an 8-year-old, when he drank champagne underneath a table at one of his father’s Senate reelection parties.Decades later, Hunter was looking desperately for crack cocaine in Franklin Square around the time his father, two miles away on Capitol Hill, was spearheading a crime bill cracking down on drug abuse.Hunter’s older brother Beau had often acted as a protector, helping get Hunter treatment in 2003, and ensuring that he stayed sober for a time. After Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, it removed an anchor of the family.Hunter entered a romantic relationship with his brother’s widow, a romance that he would later say was built on grief. He also spiraled into the depths of addiction that tested the bonds of the family.His father — at the time the vice president — traveled less than three miles from the Naval Observatory to confront Hunter in a dingy apartment that nearly led to a physical confrontation, according to Hunter’s memoir.“I know you’re not fine, Hunter,” Biden said. “You need help.”It led to a stint in rehab that briefly got him back on his feet.“Dad saved me,” Hunter wrote. “He never let me forget that all was not lost. He never abandoned me, never shunned me, never judged me, no matter how bad things got.”First lady Jill Biden, often the protector of the family, said that investigations targeting Hunter were not a factor in the reelection campaign.“I love Hunter, and I’ll support him … in any way I can. And that’s how I look at things,” she told CNN during an interview on a trip to Africa.Biden has one other living child — his daughter Ashley, 42, a social worker. In addition to the loss of Beau, his infant daughter Naomi died in a 1972 car crash that also killed Biden’s first wife.“I love my son, number one. He fought an addiction problem,” Biden said on “60 Minutes” last year. “He overcame it. He wrote about it. And no, there’s not a single thing that I’ve observed at all from — that would affect me or the United States relative to my son Hunter.”His problems are far from over. He remains a target of Republican activists and congressmen. He fathered a child and denied it until a paternity test proved otherwise — and has been in an ongoing legal battle in Arkansas as he attempts to lower his child support payments. And while announcing the agreement, Weiss’s office added: “The investigation is ongoing.”At the same time, Hunter’s recent legal strategy has made clear he isn’t going to fade away, as he instead attempts to go after his longtime tormentors.And he has become more of a visible presence in recent months. He worked the room at the celebrity-filled black-tie Kennedy Center Honors ceremony last year, and he attended a state dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron in December.His role was most visible during a recent trip to Ireland, where Hunter acted as something of an adviser, advance staffer and a son all at once.He shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. He pulled Irish President Michael Higgins over to tell him, “I’m a fan of your poetry.” He and his father met Father Frank O’Grady, the priest who performed Beau Biden’s last rites and now works at Ireland’s Knock Shrine.It was a trip that was hard to imagine four years earlier, during a confrontation that took place in the weeks before Joe Biden announced his presidential campaign.Hunter, in the midst of his latest bender, came to dinner, only to find family members waiting to stage an intervention: He stormed out, his father chasing him.“He grabbed me, swung me around, and hugged me,” Hunter Biden wrote. “He held me tight in the dark and cried for the longest time.”;In the sense of, I have a healthy fear,” Hunter Biden said in 2021 at the end of a 90-minute discussion with Marc Maron on his “WTF” podcast.But you know, I’m leaving here and I’m going straight home.”In Hunter’s own accounts, Joe Biden is the figure offering unconditional love to a son.In addition to the loss of Beau, his infant daughter Naomi died in a 1972 car crash that also killed Biden’s first wife.“I love my son, number one.;2023-06-21T09:00:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:47:27.827060+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60588;Modi’s White House visit tests Biden’s democracy-vs.-autocracy pitch;Human rights groups are increasingly concerned about Hindu nationalism and democratic erosion in India;Denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over deadly religious riots in his home state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi comes to Washington on Wednesday for a state visit that will highlight his change in fortune and growing global clout, even as concerns about human rights and democratic erosion in India are intensifying across the nation he now leads.For the man rolling out the red carpet for him, President Biden, the visit underscores both the promise of strengthening ties with the world’s most populous nation and the peril of positioning his presidency as a pivotal force in the global battle between autocracy and democracy.With Modi leading the world’s largest democracy while overseeing trends that human rights groups say undermine democratic principles, Biden’s decision to host a state visit risks undermining one of his key campaign messages against Donald Trump in 2020.India is emerging as an increasingly vital player in a region the United States has prioritized in its foreign policy — a potential bulwark against China and an increasingly powerful actor in sectors including technology, defense and the arts. But the country’s tilt toward illiberalism is at odds with the kind of message Biden has embraced during his presidency about the importance of proving that democracy is a preferable model to the more autocratic principles espoused by foes such as China and Russia.Nonetheless, administration officials said, it’s important to send a message that the two countries should be able to work together in service of their respective interests.“It’s a hinge moment,” said Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, adding that the U.S.-India relationship “will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century.”Pressed on whether Biden’s autocracies-vs.-democracies argument remains relevant in the current environment, Sullivan said Washington’s feting of Modi did not conflict with the president’s broader approach to global diplomacy.“I do think we are dealing with the gathering and march of autocratic forces in ways that are not in the United States’ national interest, and that we do need to rally the values, norms and forces of democracy to push back against that,” he said in a Tuesday interview with a small group of reporters. “And that is a point the president has made consistently since he came into office. But he has also been clear that in that larger effort, we need constructive relationships with countries of all different traditions and backgrounds.”During Modi’s trip to Washington, which begins Wednesday and includes a joint address to Congress and a state dinner at the White House, the growing importance of the U.S.-India relationship will be on full display. In addition to discussing shared interests concerning China, Biden and Modi are set to announce new partnerships on defense platforms and technology — including a significant deal to jointly produce a GE fighter jet engine in India — as well as talk about trade, the war in Ukraine and India’s ambitions for a larger role on the global stage.The pomp and pageantry of a state visit will allow both men to mark a moment of recognition for the Indian diaspora on the global stage, with hundreds of business leaders, policymakers, celebrities and scholars set to gather at the White House. Vice President Harris will be one of dozens of Indian American officials hailing the ties between two countries that successive U.S. presidents have described the world’s oldest and largest democracies.Praise for the relationship — and for Modi himself — has only seemed to intensify since Biden took office.At the May 23 launch of a U.S.-India workshop to boost cooperation on 5G telecommunications, Eric Garcetti, the new U.S. ambassador to New Delhi, described India as developing in Modi’s “wonderful hands.” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in April called Modi an “unbelievable” and “visionary” figure — and the most popular leader in the world.Kurt Campbell, White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific and deputy assistant to the president, described the state visit as an opportunity to elevate the bilateral relationship to the pinnacle of global diplomacy.“My hope is that this visit … consecrates the U.S.-India relationship as the most important bilateral relationship for the United States on the global stage,” he said at the Hudson Institute this month.But human rights activists and some lawmakers are concerned that the festive atmosphere and optimistic rhetoric could overshadow important conversations about a backslide in democratic principles in India under Modi. They are writing letters to Biden and engaging in closed-door diplomacy to try to ensure that Modi feels some international pressure over his domestic policies and rhetoric.Many are pointing to Biden’s own words, in which he pledged to promote both U.S. interests and U.S. values while serving as commander in chief.“In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security,” Biden said last year, a refrain he has repeated often throughout his presidency. “This is a real test. It’s going to take time.”When it comes to democracy and human rights, “you can expect that [Biden] will say something in that vein in his public comments, as well as in his private comments” to Modi, Sullivan said. “But precisely what he says, of course, I leave to him.”The state dinner Thursday will punctuate a stunning turnaround for an Indian politician who was castigated by Western governments two decades ago after religious riots erupted in his state of Gujarat, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Muslims. Modi, a staunch Hindu nationalist and the then-Gujarat chief minister, was accused of letting the riots spread and was denied a visa by the State Department in 2005 under a law that holds foreign officials responsible for “severe violations of religious freedom.”Since Modi’s rise to national power in 2014, India has increasingly resembled an autocracy, according to independent groups such as the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, which monitors democracies around the world. Researchers have pointed to a rise in the persecution of Muslim minorities — including vigilante killings of Muslim men accused of slaughtering cows or dating Hindu women — the spread of unfettered hate speech as well as the persecution of activists, journalists and political opposition figures. In March, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was removed from Parliament, disqualified from elections and faced with possible imprisonment after he mocked Modi at a political rally. In February, the Modi government ordered Twitter and Facebook to take down links to a BBC documentary exploring Modi’s role in the Gujarat riots and detained university students who tried to hold campus screenings.Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International held a screening of the documentary in Washington on Tuesday, part of a growing effort by activists to raise awareness about India’s lurch toward repression and religious intolerance under Modi.“He’s basically utilizing this sort of proto-authoritarian Hindu nationalism for political aims thinking he can keep it all bottled up,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “He’s playing with fire.”Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), along with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), led more than 70 members of the House and Senate in an open letter to Biden on Tuesday, urging him in his upcoming conversations with Modi to address “areas of concern” in addition to the two countries’ expanding economic and strategic partnership.“A series of independent, credible reports reflect troubling signs in India toward the shrinking of political space, the rise of religious intolerance, the targeting of civil society organizations and journalists, and growing restrictions on press freedoms and internet access,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. They specifically cited the State Department’s own findings on India’s deteriorating political and religious freedoms.Modi has denied claims that there is religious intolerance in India, and rejected calls for reforms.The growing importance of India on the world stage has emboldened the prime minister, who is popular at home and leads a young, growing population that recently overtook China to become the world’s largest at 1.4 billion.“India deserves a much higher, deeper and wider profile and a role,” Modi told the Wall Street Journal.The Biden administration largely agrees with that sentiment, and it sees in India a strong potential partner that can counter China’s growing influence.One area where the United States and India have taken diverging positions is the war in Ukraine. India, which has continued to buy oil and weapons from Russia, has not publicly condemned the Russian invasion.Sullivan acknowledged that Washington and New Delhi have different perspectives on Ukraine but said it was nonetheless important for India to hear the U.S. perspective. “We think this actually sends a message” to Ukraine “that we are working to advocate on their behalf with a broader range of countries” than just NATO or Western allies.Modi is seeking a larger role for his country on the world stage — calling for India to have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It is not clear whether Biden will endorse such a move during the visit, but the state visit invitation is the latest indication that India is paying little if any price for its decision to abstain from U.N. votes condemning the invasion.On security affairs, China is pulling the United States and India together, but more broadly the “magnetism” includes the two countries’ respective market sizes and growth and strong people-to-people ties. India vies with China for the most students in the United States and tops the list for H1-B nonimmigrant visas for skilled labor, notes Richard Rossow, chair of U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The large and increasingly politically powerful Indian American diaspora is also a factor in the increasingly close relationship.Modi, who attended a 2019 rally of several thousand people alongside former president Donald Trump in Houston, maintains a large following and deep support among Indian American voters.Modi can expect to again see throngs of Indian Americans coming out for his state visit, said Shekar Narasimhan, a Democratic fundraiser who leads AAPI Victory Fund, a super PAC focused on turning out Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.“Every event is sold out,” said Narasimhan, who will be attending the state dinner and the joint address to Congress. Along with the excitement, however, “there is chagrin and teeth-gnashing” in some sectors of the diaspora over Modi’s human rights record.The Indian diaspora, like India itself, is diverse and encompasses a wide range of political viewpoints and religious faiths. While polls show that a majority of Indian Americans support Democrats, the group is far from monolithic. Even as the Biden administration will be featuring many of the hundreds of Indian American officials in government during the state visit — including Harris, top speechwriter Vinay Reddy, and Domestic Policy Council director Neera Tanden — Republicans are also ramping up their efforts to reach out to Americans of South Asian descent.Two Indian American leaders are running for the presidency in the Republican Party: former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump, the Republican front-runner, boasted of a strong relationship with Modi and has already launched a “Hindus for Trump” affinity group to pursue South Asian voters.Within that context, officials in the White House are wary of coming across as lecturing Modi — who is also popular in his country and won reelection by a comfortable margin — on human rights and democracy.“Ultimately, the question of where politics and … democratic institutions go in India is going to be determined within India by Indians,” said Sullivan. “It’s not going to be determined by the United States.”;In March, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was removed from Parliament, disqualified from elections and faced with possible imprisonment after he mocked Modi at a political rally.While polls show that a majority of Indian Americans support Democrats, the group is far from monolithic.“It’s not going to be determined by the United States.”;2023-06-21T09:00:00+00:00;2023-06-21T10:47:38.371046+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60592;Effects of Dobbs on maternal health care overwhelmingly negative, survey shows;The findings are the first nationally representative survey of OBGYNs since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling.;Sweeping restrictions and even outright abortion bans adopted by states in the year since the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling have had an overwhelmingly negative effect on maternal health care, according to a survey of OBGYNs released Wednesday that provides one of the clearest views yet of how the U.S. Supreme Court decision has affected women’s health care in the United States.The poll by the health research nonprofit KFF reveals that the Dobbs ruling — which ended federal protection on the right to abortion — affected maternal mortality and how pregnancy-related medical emergencies are managed, precipitated a rise in requests for sterilization and has done much more than restrict abortion access. Many OBGYNs said it has also made their jobs more difficult and legally perilous than before, while leading to worse outcomes for patients.The findings are the first nationally representative survey of OBGYNs since the Dobbs ruling, after which at least 15 states now ban abortion outright or within a few weeks of conception.States where abortion is legal, banned or under threatNearly 7 in 10, or 68 percent of OBGYNs, said the effects of Dobbs have made the management of pregnancy-related medical emergencies worse, while 64 percent said the ruling has worsened pregnancy-related mortality. The poll, conducted between March 17 and May 18, collected responses from a random sample of 569 board-certified OBGYNs across the country who provide sexual and reproductive health care to patients in office-based settings.The striking responses come as the number of Americans who die while giving birth — or in the weeks after — has been on the rise since 2018, from 658 that year to 1,205 in 2021, according to a March report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from 2022 has not yet been released.The responses were even grimmer regarding the already stark racial and ethnic inequities in maternal health care: 70 percent of OBGYNs said Dobbs has widened that gap. Black women are already twice as likely to suffer serious complications during pregnancy and are three times as likely to die as women of other races.Some of the earliest signs of the impact of Dobbs on women’s health were evident within weeks of the ruling. Patients with emergencies such as miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and other complications were confronted with a maze of delays or denials of care as providers were mired in confusion over swiftly changing restrictions.The Washington Post reported on several such instances last July, including on a Wisconsin woman who experienced an incomplete miscarriage and bled for more than 10 days after emergency room staff refused to remove the fetal tissue amid confusion over restrictions. At a hospital in Kansas City, Mo., administrators temporarily required “pharmacist approval” before dispensing medications used to stop postpartum hemorrhages because those drugs can also be used for abortions.In the months since, those challenges have not abated. In the KFF poll, 40 percent of OBGYNs in states where abortion is banned said they have personally experienced “constraints on management of miscarriages,” while 37 percent reported constraints on management of pregnancy-related medical emergencies.Abortion access across swaths of the country receded immediately after the Dobbs ruling, due to “trigger laws” in 13 states, mostly in the South, that immediately banned abortion when Roe v. Wade was struck down. Half of OBGYNs in states that banned abortion or had gestational limits said they had a patient who was unable to get an abortion they sought.Due to the existing conditions by which abortion was already heavily restricted in several states before last June’s decision, OBGYNs reported little difference pre- and post-Dobbs when it comes to the kinds of abortion services they provide. The share of providers of medical abortions, aspiration abortions and dilation and evacuation abortions remained virtually unchanged, while the share of office-based OBGYNs who provided any type of abortion also remained steady — about 1 in 5. State bans and institutional policies against abortion at an OBGYNs workplace were the most commonly cited reasons for not providing abortion services.Although the majority of OBGYNs said they do not provide abortion services, 62 percent said they use mifepristone with misoprostol for miscarriage management. But the drug’s future availability is under threat after antiabortion advocates filed a lawsuit challenging access to mifepristone.The drug is used to manage miscarriages and is also commonly used in medical abortions — which now account for more than half of abortion procedures in the country. They became critically important after Dobbs, because they were seen as the key way to circumvent strict state bans by enabling patients to manage an abortion in the privacy of their own homes after procuring them out of state or having them sent through the mail.As abortion access grew scarce in parts of the country, more than half of OBGYNs (55 percent) reported an increased number of patients seeking some form of birth control — particularly long-lasting solutions: 43 percent of OBGYNs saw an increase in requests for sterilization, while 47 percent saw increased demand for intrauterine devices and implants. OBGYNs in states with abortion bans or where it is greatly limited were more likely to report an increase in demand than those in states where abortion is generally available.Though nearly all OBGYNs reported providing contraceptive care, far fewer offered emergency contraception. About one-third of OBGYNs prescribe or provide all three methods of emergency contraception (IUDs and two forms of pills), while 15 percent of OBGYNs said they did not provide patients any method of emergency contraception.After Dobbs last June, some states rushed to tack on penalties for abortion providers that dramatically increased both criminal and civil liability for OBGYNs — a new legal climate that forced many providers to second-guess maternal health-care decisions once considered routine.Forty-two percent of OBGYNs nationwide reported being “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the legal risks they could face when making decisions about patient care and the necessity of abortion. The number was higher — 61 percent — for providers in states with abortion bans and 59 percent in states with gestational limits, compared with 27 percent of providers in states where abortion is available.More than half of OBGYNs nationwide — 55 percent — said the Dobbs ruling made it harder to attract new OBGYNs to the field.Early data suggests the fear could be well-placed, though it’s disproportionately being seen in parts of the country most hostile to abortion access. States that have enacted abortion bans saw a 10.5 percent drop this year in applicants for obstetrics and gynecology residencies compared with the previous year, according to an April report from the Association of American Medical Colleges.Doctors have said laws that restrict abortion with carve-outs for saving the life of the pregnant person are vague and confusing, and force providers into the impossible position of weighing a medical judgment against a legal one. A miscalculation in some states could mean prison time.Already, the calculus has proved to be too much for some providers or their hospitals. Earlier this year, a hospital in rural Idaho said it was shuttering its obstetrics unit after almost 75 years, owing to a shortage of pediatricians, fewer deliveries and the “legal and political climate” in a state where abortion is highly restricted in most circumstances.Scott Clement contributed to this report.Tracking abortion access in the U.S.: After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v.

60593;Rep. Boebert introduces privileged resolution to impeach President Biden;The privilege resolution comes after another far-right Republican used the same motion to censure a Democratic colleague last week;Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) has introduced a privileged resolution to impeach President Biden, citing a “dereliction of duty” and “abuse of power” over his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.By introducing the articles of impeachment under a privileged resolution, Boebert has superseded House Republican leadership’s ability to control what comes to the House floor. By bypassing the usual process for bringing legislation to a full House vote, Boebert’s action would force lawmakers to vote on the measure in the next two days. But House Democrats announced Tuesday they will move to table the resolution, which would effectively prevent the House from considering a vote on final passage that would impeach Biden.It’s unclear whether Boebert’s resolution would be successful in the Republican House majority. But several Republican lawmakers and aides privately lamented Tuesday evening that the move is a distraction when government-minded members are trying to focus on finessing myriad appropriations bills before an upcoming two-week recess.Boebert, who like other far-right lawmakers has repeatedly called for Biden’s removal from office, claims in the resolution that the president has violated his oath for “knowingly” failing to enforce federal immigration laws, among other accusations.“President Biden has pursued this open border agenda purposefully and willfully, circumventing every safeguard, check, and balance required by law, resulting in mass illegal immigration into the United States to the detriment of the American people,” Boebert said on the House floor Tuesday evening.In response, White House Counsel’s Office spokesman Ian Sams condemned Boebert’s actions as an effort to distract from House Republicans’ ineffectualness in the majority.“Instead of working with President Biden on solutions to the issues that matter most to the American people, like creating jobs, lowering costs and strengthening health care, extreme House Republicans are staging baseless political stunts that do nothing to help real people and only serve to get themselves attention,” he said in a statement.Boebert is the second lawmaker from the staunchly conservative House Freedom Caucus to introduce a privileged resolution in just one week, a sign that the small group of far-right Republicans is becoming more emboldened. The group has been incensed since Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) largely circumvented their demands to dramatically cut spending when striking a deal with the Biden administration to lift the debt ceiling and avert economic calamity last month.The far-right flank of lawmakers was so angry over the deal that they prevented the House from voting on noncontroversial, partisan legislation for one week until they could ensure concessions from McCarthy. Several Freedom Caucus lawmakers, as well as other hard-right Republicans, relented on their floor blockade once McCarthy directed appropriators to match next year’s government funding to 2022 fiscal year spending levels and allowed an immediate vote on a resolution that would repeal a Biden administration gun regulation.Boebert’s move comes after Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) introduced a privileged resolution to censure and fine Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) last week for investigating President Donald Trump. That resolution failed after 20 Republicans voted with Democrats to table it, specifically pointing to the $16 million fine as unconstitutional and fearing the action could set a precedent for a Democratic majority to do the same to a Republican in the minority.Luna reintroduced the resolution Tuesday evening after stripping the fine to appease moderates and libertarians. It is now expected to pass as early as Wednesday.“A majority of 20 are switching their vote to support the new resolution and some members who were out of town will be voting with us,” Luna tweeted Tuesday evening.Luna’s push could inspire other far-right lawmakers to fast-track their own prioritized resolutions that largely dabble in culture war issues that ignite Trump’s base. Boebert shouted out her effort on Twitter Tuesday, writing to Luna, “Love your leadership on this! Thank you!”;By bypassing the usual process for bringing legislation to a full House vote, Boebert’s action would force lawmakers to vote on the measure in the next two days.Boebert shouted out her effort on Twitter Tuesday, writing to Luna, “Love your leadership on this!Thank you!”;2023-06-21T02:54:06+00:00;2023-06-21T10:48:26.205702+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60594;Who is David Weiss, lead prosecutor in the Hunter Biden case?;What to know about David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, who led the Hunter Biden investigation.;President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, has reached a tentative agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to two minor tax crimes and admit to the facts of a gun charge under terms that are likely to keep him out of jail, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.David Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, launched the high-profile investigation in 2018 and ultimately made the decision that Hunter Biden should be charged. Here’s what you need to know about Weiss.President Donald Trump nominated Weiss, a longtime federal prosecutor, to serve as the U.S. attorney in Delaware in 2017. The U.S. Senate confirmed him for the job in early 2018.The Biden administration asked nearly all of Trump’s U.S. attorneys to step down, which is typical for new presidents when they take office. But the administration asked Weiss, who was already heading the Hunter Biden investigation, to stay on. Removing Weiss was likely to have sparked political backlash, as he was investigating the president’s son.Attorney General Merrick Garland has repeatedly said that Weiss had full independence to steer the investigation.The investigation into Hunter Biden began in 2018 and became a central focus for Trump during his unsuccessful 2020 reelection effort. Initially, the investigation centered around Biden’s finances related to overseas business ties and consulting work. Over time, investigators with multiple agencies focused closely on whether Biden did not report all of his income, and whether he lied on gun purchase paperwork in 2018, people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case, previously told The Washington Post.Weiss has spent much of his career in the U.S. attorney’s office in Wilmington — the same office he now leads. He served as the first assistant U.S. attorney in the Delaware office between 2007 and 2009, was acting and interim U.S. attorney from 2009 to 2011, then returned to the first assistant U.S. attorney position between 2012 and 2018.After graduating from Washington University in St. Louis and the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Weiss clerked for Justice Andrew D. Christie of the Delaware Supreme Court, then worked as a line prosecutor for three years, according to his Justice Department biography. He entered private practice and became a partner at the law firm Duane Morris before becoming a top executive at the Siegfried Group, a financial services firm.Federal prosecutors generally do not speak about ongoing investigations, and Weiss has followed that rule. The Post reported in October that federal agents investigating Biden believed they gathered sufficient evidence months ago to charge him with tax crimes and a false statement related to a gun purchase but were waiting on Weiss to make a decision on whether to file such charges.Now that a plea deal has been reached, it is possible he will make a public statement.;Here’s what you need to know about Weiss.President Donald Trump nominated Weiss, a longtime federal prosecutor, to serve as the U.S. attorney in Delaware in 2017.But the administration asked Weiss, who was already heading the Hunter Biden investigation, to stay on.Initially, the investigation centered around Biden’s finances related to overseas business ties and consulting work.;2023-06-20T23:13:09+00:00;2023-06-21T10:48:35.880657+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60595;Biden allies praise Hunter plea deal as ‘justice.’ Trump sees opposite.;Trump’s rivals in the Republican nomination fight joined Trump in his outrage, making similar claims.;Allies of President Biden described his son Hunter’s federal plea deal Tuesday on misdemeanor tax and gun charges as evidence of the integrity of the criminal justice system.But former president Donald Trump, who has separately been indicted by the Justice Department, joined other Republicans in calling the plea confirmation of the opposite.“Wow! The corrupt Biden DOJ just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere ‘traffic ticket.’ Our system is BROKEN!” Trump posted after the plea was announced on Truth Social. He did not provide evidence for his corruption claims.Trump’s rivals in the Republican nomination fight joined Trump in his outrage, making similar claims. Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy described the deal as “an Orwellian gesture that gives the news media exactly the level of cover that they needed” to continue justifying the Trump indictment. Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said in a statement that the deal “only raises further questions about Hunter Biden’s crimes and the double standard of justice.”“If Hunter was not connected to the elite DC class he would have been put in jail a long time ago,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said in a tweet.Congressional Republicans echoed the concern. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) called the plea deal “a stunt.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) called the agreement “a slap on the wrist.” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called it a “sweetheart deal.”“Lets be clear: the Department of Justice’s charges against President Biden’s son represents a two-tiered system of justice,” House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) said in a statement.David Brock, the president of Facts First USA, a group founded to push back on Republican attacks against Hunter Biden, said the charging decision against the president’s son meant justice had been served.“This episode just underscores the integrity of President Biden — he kept Trump’s U.S. attorney on to investigate a matter involving his own son,” Brock said in a statement. “This President has repeatedly demonstrated his belief in the rule of law and the independence of the Justice Department.”Hunter Biden, 53, agreed to plead guilty in a deal brokered with Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Trump appointee, to misdemeanor charges of willful failure to pay taxes. He also admitted to the facts of a gun charge, according to a court filing, which does not constitute a guilty plea. Both cases date back to before his father’s election as president, during a time when he has admitted to regularly using crack cocaine.The firearm charge, related to Biden denying his drug use when he purchased a gun, is expected to result in pretrial diversion. He is also expected to face no jail time for the tax charges, which arise over debts that Biden’s attorneys say he has since paid to the government.Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he gave full control of the investigation to Weiss and would not interfere in any charging decision. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said President Biden has no involvement with the criminal investigations of his son or Trump.“The President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment,” White House spokesman Ian Sams said in a statement Tuesday after the plea announcement.Republicans seeking the White House have for months pointed to Hunter’s legal troubles and ongoing investigations by House Republicans of his connections to foreign companies as evidence of what former vice president Mike Pence, like Comer, has called a “two-tiered system of justice unfolding in America.”After Trump was indicted on federal charges related to mishandling classified documents and obstruction of justice, DeSantis suggested that the Justice Department was playing favorites.“Why so zealous in pursuing Trump yet so passive about Hillary or Hunter?” he asked in a tweet, referring to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.Trump, for his part, has claimed without specific evidence that his own indictment is part of an effort by the Justice Department to distract from Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, which has uncovered unverified allegations — but no proof — that President Biden was involved in his son’s business dealings.As president, Trump demanded that his Justice Department investigate Hunter Biden, an unusual public demand by a president to investigate a political rival. After his own federal indictment, Trump cast the investigation of Hunter Biden as an effort to make his own prosecution look more justified.“They’ll probably come up with a jaywalking charge on Hunter in the not too distant future, you know, a very small charge, so they can say well, ‘It’s fair,’” Trump said in a June 11 appearance on a radio show hosted by Roger Stone, his former adviser. “But there’s a very unfair situation. We’re living in a very, very corrupt country.”Stone was convicted of seven felonies related to obstructing an investigation of Russia’s involvement in the 2016 elections. Trump commuted Stone’s sentence before leaving office.Amy B Wang contributed to this report.Several major Republican candidates and three Democrats have officially declared they are running for their party’s 2024 presidential nomination, and others are making moves.

60596;The tedious demand that everything be subjected to made-for-TV ‘debate’;There are few better ways to ensure that Americans come away incompletely informed.;Debate is one of the cornerstones of the American political system. It’s rooted in the noblest of sentiments: that the population should hear from candidates and, duly informed, decide among them.It’s what Abraham Lincoln did, right? He became a national figure because of his debates with incumbent Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois. Those Lincoln-Douglas debates didn’t result in Lincoln’s ousting Douglas, but they did pave the way for his election as president in 1860. Two noble candidates, exchanging views, influencing the electorate.This is no longer how it works. At the presidential level, debates are functionally useless. And below that level, it’s even worse.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpMy intent here isn’t to write about politics and the presidency but, instead, the increasingly common idea that public, broadcast debate is the best format for adjudicating issues. Since that probably derives from the tradition of debate in American politics, though, it’s useful to point out how that system is broken.Imagine a presidential contest between two candidates who saw the scheduled debates as opportunities to earnestly present their points of view and challenge their opponent’s. There are three scheduled, each lasting 90 minutes. Commercial breaks bring the total down to, say, 80 minutes apiece, so four hours in total.The Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, the gold standard, lasted 21 hours. There were seven encounters, in which one candidate spoke for an hour, followed by the other candidate speaking for 90 minutes. The first candidate then had half an hour for a rebuttal. So, of course, there was more detail, more compelling rhetoric! There was more time to present points, and there were more opportunities to prepare what the candidates were going to say.A critical point here is that the spoken word conveys information at a much slower rate than does print. Read the preceding paragraph again to yourself and then read it out loud. See the gap? Now imagine the difference in giving someone an hour to read something vs. an hour to watch a discussion. In which case is more information conveyed?Even those three 90-minute debates posited above probably won’t draw the audience that presidential debates used to. Instead, many people will see only snippets of the debate on social media — often the ones that their political coalition found most useful. And that’s assuming well-intentioned actors! Throw in a candidate who wants only to steamroll his opponent, and the informational value of the affair collapses almost entirely.Which brings us to the predilection for calls — particularly from young conservative men — that nearly everything be subject to “debate.”It’s not immediately clear where this pattern began, and it doesn’t really matter. Maybe it simply evolved out of the cable news world and such shows as “Crossfire.” Perhaps it was the rise of commentator Ben Shapiro or the weird subplot in the 2016 campaign that Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) should win the Republican nomination solely because his supporters salivated at his dismantling Hillary Clinton in a debate. Whatever the provenance, it is now an established tactic, so much so that it has inspired memes and cartoons alike.It certainly would not have become what it is without the internet and social media. A combination of internet-dependent things — echo chambers in which people become convinced that they are both well-versed and correct, a system that rewards viral dissections of one’s opponents — helps drive the idea that real-time debate is the best mechanism for resolving disagreement.Perhaps the most important factor, though, is the internet’s reinforcement of the idea that people can become experts on anything by “doing their own research.” Often this simply means substituting the views of an actual expert for the views of someone who is questioning the expert, rewarding the perhaps innate sense in people (and particularly young men) that they know better than the people who are telling them what to do. Without this sense that anyone can reach conclusions about complicated issues that are as valid as those of people who’ve spent years studying the subject, though, this call for “debate” immediately collapses. After all, in no objective sense does an entertainer-turned-podcast host have an equal claim to expertise as an expert. But in a world where the words of a woman who spent four years of college and 10 years in the field on a subject sit alongside Alex Jones in Google search results, figuring out whom to trust is seen as a coin flip.(There’s a corollary here, of course: the decreased confidence Americans have in institutions and expertise. It has been useful for various actors — snake-oil salesmen, politicians, criminals — to cast authority as suspect and unreliable. It has been easy to cherry-pick examples when that has been the case, maligning authority in general. In this carefully crafted world, that Google-result equivalence is much easier to draw.)What’s also important here is that the audience for debates between figures of authority and those who derive power from professional skepticism has, almost without exception, already made up its mind. You don’t think that the question of the efficacy of vaccines can be resolved by a debate between Robert Kennedy Jr. and a robustly educated doctor who is an expert on vaccines, as podcast host Joe Rogan has demanded, if you don’t already side with Kennedy. You and he differ only in the degree of your skepticism.Of course some purported experts are dishonest or wrong! The debunked idea that vaccines are linked to autism derives largely from an abuse of the medical research process. But there is a process, however imperfect, for vetting and evaluating claims about science and medicine. It involves other experts reviewing and considering the subject. It involves testing methodologies and writing lengthy papers articulating competing claims and arguments. That autism research was retracted — not that anti-vaccine advocates are universally willing to accept it.Now imagine a scenario with an expert who is objectively correct about a subject. She is challenged to a debate by a guy who read a thing online and she agrees to participate. It turns out, though, that the expert isn’t very good at debating — or, as is very often the case, her opponent is disinterested in actually debating in favor of yelling at and belittling her. For those watching, the effect is that the expert was unable to defend her position. Clips spread on social media. The idea that the objectively correct position is indefensible spreads widely. No one reads her research — not that most people would understand it even if they did.The reality is that these seemingly incessant calls for debate are lazy cop-outs, ideally suited for the rhetorical moment. No one is sitting through a 21-hour-long series of debates. Few people read policy papers from candidates. We have trained ourselves to be less well-informed and convinced ourselves that we’re smarter for doing so.We have turned “debate” into a cudgel meant not to inform but to entertain, to validate our skepticism and to feed our dislike of our opponents. Change my mind: Maybe we should stop?;In which case is more information conveyed?Even those three 90-minute debates posited above probably won’t draw the audience that presidential debates used to.Instead, many people will see only snippets of the debate on social media — often the ones that their political coalition found most useful.That autism research was retracted — not that anti-vaccine advocates are universally willing to accept it.Now imagine a scenario with an expert who is objectively correct about a subject.;2023-06-20T21:41:09+00:00;2023-06-21T10:48:54.973632+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60598;Judge Cannon sets Trump trial for August, but it’s not likely to stick;U.S. Judge Aileen Cannon wrote Tuesday that Donald Trump's trial would be scheduled for August, with hearings held in her Fort Pierce, Fla., courthouse.;The judge presiding over the Justice Department’s criminal case against former president Donald Trump said Tuesday that the trial could begin as early as Aug. 14 — a timetable that is likely to be pushed back as lawyers navigate the complexities of an unprecedented case that hinges on highly sensitive classified documents.Judge Aileen M. Cannon, a federal judge in Florida, wrote in a court filing that hearings in the case would be held in her Fort Pierce courthouse, though she noted that location could change as the criminal proceedings get underway.The government filed its 38-count indictment against Trump and his valet, Walt Nauta, in the West Palm Beach courthouse, about an hour south of Fort Pierce. Cannon has the authority to decide in which of the five divisions within the Southern District of Florida the trial will take place.“This case is hereby set for a Criminal Jury Trial during the two-week period commencing August 14, 2023, or as soon thereafter as the case may be called. A Calendar Call will be held at 1:45 p.m. on August 8, 2023,” Cannon wrote.She asked lawyers on both sides to file any pretrial motions by July 24.The speedy timetable suggests Cannon does not want Trump’s trial proceedings to drag on. But legal experts say the case could face numerous delays because of the rules and procedures related to handling classified information at trial, and is likely to take longer than most to reach a jury.Trump, the first former U.S. president ever charged with a crime, is accused of illegally withholding 31 documents containing classified national defense information. That means his lawyers need to obtain the necessary security clearance to view the evidence — a process that could take months.When announcing the indictment, special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the case for the Justice Department, said he would push for a speedy trial.1/6Trump is again running for president and is leading in the polls for the Republican nomination. His Florida court proceedings — along with hearings and appearances in an unrelated indictment on fraud charges in New York — appear likely to take place alongside the 2024 primary and general election campaigns.Trump and some of his GOP competitors have slammed both investigations as partisan. If a Republican is elected president and takes office before the federal trial is concluded, he or she could try to push the Justice Department to drop the charges against Trump, which would end the criminal proceedings.The case will be tried under the rules of the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA — a law that spells out pretrial steps that must be taken to decide what classified information will be used in court and how. Those steps take time, adding to the likelihood of multiple delays before trial.Judge Aileen Cannon’s pivotal role in Donald Trump’s criminal trialDavid Aaron, a former Justice Department lawyer who prosecuted national security cases, said it’s unlikely that Trump’s lawyers and the Justice Department could conclude the discovery process in time for the trial to begin in August.Among other things, Aaron said, the law requires the Justice Department to file a motion in court declaring that its case involves classified documents to initiate the CIPA proceedings. Based on what’s viewable on the public court docket, it did not appear that the Justice Department had made that filing as of Tuesday afternoon.“This could just be a placeholder,” Aaron said of the mid-August timetable laid out by Cannon. “Unless there have been communications that we do not know about and the government has streamlined the usual process and the defense has agreed to that process — this schedule is going to change.”Legal experts have said Cannon’s lack of experience in trials related to national security also could slow the proceedings. Cannon, 42, was nominated by Trump during his final year in office and has less than three years on the federal bench.Last fall, she issued a controversial ruling in response to a lawsuit Trump filed that initially delayed the FBI review of classified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago. She was roundly reversed by a conservative panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.Federal court officials in southern Florida have said Cannon was assigned randomly to preside over the trial after Trump was indicted by a Miami grand jury this month.The latest: Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he broke the law by keeping and hiding top secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The judge set a trial date for Aug. 14, but legal experts say the case could face numerous delays.The charges: Trump is accused of violating seven federal laws but faces 37 separate charges. Here’s a breakdown of all of the charges against Trump and what they mean. Read the full text of the Trump indictment and our top takeaways from the indictment.The case: The criminal investigation looks into whether Trump took government secrets with him after he left the White House and obstructed a subsequent investigation.

60599;Post-indictment polling doesn’t yet spell doom for Trump;Or a boost for Ron DeSantis.;"There is an expansive graveyard of scandals, gaffes and falsehoods that were at one point speculated to be catalysts for Donald Trump’s political demise. From his comments about immigrants in the first moments of his 2016 candidacy to the Capitol riot to nearly everything since, someone has theorized that this thing, maybe, might be the point at which Trump’s base of support finally crumbles.As you are probably aware, it has not.But Trump has never faced a situation like the one formalized earlier this month when the Justice Department obtained a federal criminal indictment against the former president. The lengthy indictment spelled out in detail Trump’s efforts to retain documents marked as classified, including his alleged attempts to subvert a 2022 subpoena. It is a unique situation, to put it mildly.So, even for a weary, cynical public, the question arises anew: Could this actually hobble Trump’s political support?And a new poll from CNN has an unsatisfying answer: Maybe?Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThe most important shift in the new CNN poll, conducted by SSRS, is in Trump’s favorability rating. In a poll that was completed May 20, Trump was viewed favorably by three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. In the new poll, that’s down to 65 percent. That 10-point drop is significant.But it’s not reflected in other polling. The Economist’s poll, conducted by YouGov, shows less change over a similar time frame. Trump’s favorability with Republicans was down 2 points; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, his main opponent, saw no change in his favorability.There’s an important distinction between those polls. The CNN figure includes both Republicans and independents likely to vote in a Republican primary. The Economist’s numbers are only Republicans. Among Republicans, the CNN poll shows a 6-point drop — suggesting that Trump lost more support from Republican-leaning independents than members of his own party. That comports with past polling that shows Trump’s opponents, particularly DeSantis, benefiting from the inclusion of independent voters.CNN’s poll has other significant changes, too. In the horse race question — that is, which Republicans receive the most overall support — Trump dropped 6 points relative to May. Interestingly, DeSantis didn’t gain at all. Instead, other candidates (including former vice president Mike Pence) saw gains. That’s different from the long-term trend recorded in FiveThirtyEight’s national polling average, in which Trump and DeSantis have consistently vacuumed up three-quarters of the vote. When one gains, the other loses. CNN is capturing something slightly different.In part, it seems, that’s because while the percentage of possible primary voters who said they definitely wouldn’t vote for Trump jumped by 7 points since May, the percent who said the same of DeSantis ran in parallel.Digging slightly deeper into the CNN numbers, there are more indications that the indictment isn’t necessarily going to doom the former president. Those who say they plan to support Trump are more likely than other Republicans (and people overall) to say they’re paying attention to news about the indictment. But even among possible primary voters who plan to support someone else, most give Trump the benefit of the doubt on the questions the indictment raises.Notably, only about a third of those who right now plan to vote for someone else say that Trump did something illegal, that he put national security at risk or that he acted differently than had past presidents. Most of those not planning to vote for Trump say that he acted unethically but not at the risk of national security and not in an unusual way.About half of possible primary voters say they plan to vote for someone besides Trump. A third of that group is about 18 percent of the total — not too far from the 23 percent who say they won’t vote for Trump no matter what. If that one-fifth of the primary pool is out of Trump’s reach, he can take some solace in the four-fifths still actively or open to voting for him.It’s also worth noting that Trump’s position in the CNN poll is still an improvement over his numbers in March. Then, Trump had a 4-point lead over DeSantis. Now, it’s 21 points. Again: something in which to take solace.Here we introduce the familiar caveat. It’s early. Things can still change. The indictment could spiral out of control for Trump. Et cetera, et cetera. In other words, this could still be the thing that finally erodes Trump’s base of support in the party.Or maybe it’s just another stone in that ever-expanding cemetery.";Among Republicans, the CNN poll shows a 6-point drop — suggesting that Trump lost more support from Republican-leaning independents than members of his own party.That comports with past polling that shows Trump’s opponents, particularly DeSantis, benefiting from the inclusion of independent voters.CNN’s poll has other significant changes, too.Those who say they plan to support Trump are more likely than other Republicans (and people overall) to say they’re paying attention to news about the indictment.;2023-06-20T19:50:51+00:00;2023-06-21T10:49:24.258450+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60600;Hunter Biden reaches deal to plead guilty in tax, gun case;Hunter Biden, President Biden's son, was investigated by U.S. Attorney David Weiss of Delaware, a holdover from the Trump administration.;President Biden’s son Hunter has reached a tentative agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to two minor tax crimes and admit to the facts of a gun charge under terms that would probably keep him out of jail, according to court papers filed Tuesday.Any proposed plea deal would have to be approved by a federal judge. Both the prosecutors and the defense counsel have requested a court hearing at which Hunter Biden, 53, can enter his plea.The younger Biden’s attorney said the deal means the long-running criminal investigation involving the president’s son “is resolved.” But Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss, the lead prosecutor in the case, said the investigation “is ongoing,” suggesting that matters beyond the tax and gun issues are still under scrutiny.The probe was opened in 2018, during the administration of President Donald Trump. Since 2020, Republican politicians have repeatedly accused Hunter Biden of broad wrongdoing in his overseas business deals and predicted that the Biden administration would be reluctant to pursue the case. The terms of the proposed deal — negotiated with Weiss, a holdover from Trump’s administration — were quickly dismissed Tuesday by congressional Republicans, who vowed to continue investigating the Biden family.Papers filed in federal court in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday indicate that Hunter Biden has tentatively agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges of failure to pay in 2017 and 2018. A court document says that in both those years, Biden was a resident of Washington and received taxable income of more than $1.5 million, for which he owed more than $100,000 in income tax that he did not pay on time. Prosecutors plan to recommend a sentence of probation for those counts, according to people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe elements of the case that are not yet public. Biden’s representatives have previously said that he eventually paid the IRS what he owed.The second court filing is about the gun charge. In that case, the letter says, “the defendant has agreed to enter a Pretrial Diversion Agreement with respect to the firearm Information.” Handling the gun charge as a diversion case means Biden would not technically be pleading guilty to that crime. Diversion is an option typically applied to nonviolent offenders with substance abuse problems.In all, prosecutors will recommend two years of probation and diversion conditions, the people familiar with the plea deal said. If Biden successfully meets the conditions of the diversion program, the gun charge will be removed from his record at the end of that period, these people said.“Hunter will take responsibility for two instances of failure to file tax payments when due,” one of his lawyers, Chris Clark, said in a written statement. “A firearm charge, which will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be the subject of the plea agreement, will also be filed by the Government. I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.”The gun purchase that led to the criminal charge happened in late 2018, at a time when, by his own telling in his autobiography, Hunter Biden was regularly abusing crack cocaine. When he filled out paperwork to buy the gun, however, he denied using drugs or having a drug problem, exposing him to a potential charge of making a false statement on the document, as well as illegal gun possession once he acquired the weapon. Biden owned the gun for less than two weeks because his then-girlfriend threw it away, according to public accounts of that time period.White House spokesperson Ian Sams declined to comment Tuesday other than to say that the president and first lady “love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life.”Biden’s defenders have argued that Hunter Biden is a recovering addict accused of relatively minor offenses — the type of case that would not typically be prosecuted by federal authorities, barring some additional aggravating factors that are not present in this case. They suggest that the investigation would have been dropped long ago if he wasn’t the president’s son.Republicans seeking to win back the White House have sought to tie Hunter Biden’s legal woes directly to his father, focusing in particular on the younger Biden’s deal with the Chinese firm CEFC and his membership on the board of the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. Critics of the Bidens have claimed that the alleged wrongdoing goes far beyond a simple tax and gun case, and have accused the Justice Department of trying to avoid prosecuting more serious matters.Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he gave full authority over the investigation to Weiss, a Trump appointee, and would not interfere in any charging decision.Still, the plea deal is likely to become grist for the 2024 presidential race, as the nation’s two main parties once again debate the influence of politics on law enforcement and the effects of law enforcement investigations on political campaigns.Trump, who is the early front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, was indicted this month on 37 federal charges of withholding highly sensitive national security information at his Florida home and private club and trying to prevent the federal government from regaining possession of that material. He has denied wrongdoing.The 45th president frequently tries to contrast the Justice Department’s treatment of Hunter Biden with his own legal jeopardy, and Tuesday was no exception. Less than an hour after Biden’s plea agreement was filed in court, Trump took to social media to criticize the deal, saying that the Justice Department had “just cleared up hundreds of years of criminal liability by giving Hunter Biden a mere ‘traffic ticket.’ Our system is BROKEN!”Congressional Republicans also quickly issued statements insisting they would keep digging into Hunter Biden’s finances. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) called the deal “a slap on the wrist” and “a sweetheart plea deal,” adding, “We will not rest until the full extent of President Biden’s involvement in the family’s schemes are revealed.”The Fix: Breaking down the GOP investigations into the Biden familyFederal authorities began investigating Hunter Biden’s finances in 2018. Much of that work has centered on whether he evaded paying taxes on money he collected from overseas business clients. Last year, witnesses were called before a grand jury in Wilmington to answer questions about what they knew about Biden’s spending and work. Over time, the inquiry expanded to look at whether Biden’s gun purchase amounted to a crime.People familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case, told The Washington Post in October that federal agents had determined there was enough evidence to file tax and gun charges. Last month, The Post reported that prosecutors in the case were nearing a decision.Lying on the government forms needed to purchase a firearm represents a small percentage of the nation’s overall firearm-related prosecutions. Between October 2022 and March 2023, federal prosecutors filed 3,863 cases in which the unlawful possession of a firearm was the lead charge, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC database, which gathers federal data. In 130 of those cases, or about 3 percent, the lead unlawful-possession charge was related to making a false statement to acquire the weapon.During that same six-month period, federal prosecutors in Delaware filed nine cases in which unlawful gun possession was the lead charge, according to the TRAC data. One of the nine involved making a false statement to acquire the weapon.Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor whose research focuses on gun policy, said prosecutors typically would not charge lying on a gun form as a stand-alone crime, instead filing it as a secondary charge when someone also may have committed a violent crime with the weapon.In the months leading up to the plea agreement, Hunter Biden took a more public and publicly combative stance in the face of the Republican allegations against him. His revamped legal team filed countersuits, issued criminal referral letters and sent cease-and-desist letters to some of those who have publicly argued that he committed crimes.In April, he also was part of a high-profile visit to Ireland with his father, who introduced him enthusiastically to crowds, along with the president’s sister.Hunter Biden’s finances became a subject of heated debate during the 2020 presidential campaign, in part because of reports in the New York Post about a laptop computer that he purportedly dropped off at a Wilmington repair shop in 2019 and never came back to collect.The laptop was turned over to the FBI in December 2019, according to documents reviewed by The Post, and a copy of the drive was obtained by Rudy Giuliani and other advisers to then-President Trump a few months before the 2020 election.As the election drew closer, Republicans pressed the FBI and the Justice Department to explain the status of the Biden investigation and the relevance of the laptop to that investigation. The bureau declined to do so, citing the intense criticism directed at the FBI in 2016 for publicly reopening an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton just weeks before Trump’s victory at the polls.In December 2020, after Joe Biden was elected, FBI agents approached Hunter Biden, seeking to question him about his finances, and he publicly confirmed he was under investigation.At the time, a spokesman for Joe Biden said the president-elect had “never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever.”Tyler Pager contributed to this report.;Biden’s representatives have previously said that he eventually paid the IRS what he owed.The second court filing is about the gun charge.“A firearm charge, which will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be the subject of the plea agreement, will also be filed by the Government.He has denied wrongdoing.The 45th president frequently tries to contrast the Justice Department’s treatment of Hunter Biden with his own legal jeopardy, and Tuesday was no exception.;2023-06-20T18:19:16+00:00;2023-06-21T10:49:34.049919+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60601;Here are the charges in Hunter Biden’s plea deal, and what it means;The president's son will plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges and reach a separate deal on a gun charge. He will probably avoid jail time as a result.;Hunter Biden has reached a tentative agreement to plead guilty to two minor tax crimes and admit to the facts of a gun charge, according to court papers filed Tuesday. Here’s what that means and what could happen to the president’s son.The president’s son has been under investigation by the Justice Department since 2018, when Donald Trump was in the White House. The investigation has been led by U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who was appointed by Trump as the lead federal prosecutor in Delaware, the Bidens’ home state.Investigators originally cast a broad net, looking at Hunter Biden’s various overseas business work. But their work eventually narrowed to focus on Biden’s taxes and his gun purchase.Attorney General Merrick Garland did not remove Weiss as U.S. attorney, even as the Biden administration replaced other Trump appointees with its own picks in most other states. Garland has said he gave Weiss full authority to make charging decisions regarding the Hunter Biden case.The only comment he made was to acknowledge the investigation in 2020 in a statement: “I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.”But as the investigation wrapped up, he started taking a more aggressive posture against his critics.On Tuesday, one of his lawyers, Chris Clark, said in a written statement: “I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.”Biden’s plea deal means he probably won’t have to go to jail or face a trial, if the judge agrees. But he will have to go to court in Delaware in the coming days to officially plead guilty.The indictment is still likely to become a major feature of the 2024 presidential campaign. Democrats have made much of the fact that Trump is the first former president to be indicted, and more charges could be coming. And Trump and his allies have frequently cried “What about Hunter?” as they deflected questions about the Trump investigations.A spokesperson for President Biden said in a statement on Tuesday: “The President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment.”;He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.”Biden’s plea deal means he probably won’t have to go to jail or face a trial, if the judge agrees.Democrats have made much of the fact that Trump is the first former president to be indicted, and more charges could be coming.We will have no further comment.”;2023-06-20T16:51:14+00:00;2023-06-21T10:49:43.674186+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60602;Breaking down the GOP investigation into Hunter Biden and family;What House Republicans are investigating about the Biden family, and where they lack evidence;"Hunter Biden will plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges after a years-long federal investigation into his business deals. But House Republicans insist there is more to uncover and are continuing their investigations into the Biden family.They’ve been investigating the president’s son and his finances for a year now, with little to show for it. Not only are their allegations much broader than what federal prosecutors charged Hunter Biden with, they have yet to provide any concrete evidence of wrongdoing.Federal prosecutors originally cast a broad net, too, before narrowing their work to focus on the taxes and a gun Hunter Biden purchased.Here’s a rundown of the GOP allegations into the Biden family.Republicans have made a stunning allegation: That Biden was involved in a “criminal scheme” in which he received millions of dollars from a foreigner in exchange for a policy decision when he was vice president. Congressional Republicans say they know of a whistleblower within the Justice Department who alleges this.The evidence: We should approach this claim with extreme skepticism. For one, the FBI has indicated there is no pres. The document Republicans seized on to make this claim is a form the FBI uses to record unverified tips, and the FBI reviewed and closed the inquiry. The FBI stressed that in its response to Republicans: “The FBI regularly receives information from sources with significant potential biases, motivations, and knowledge, including drug traffickers, members of organized crime, or even terrorists. … Recording the information does not validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI.”House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) threatened the head of the FBI, Christopher A. Wray, with a contempt of Congress citation if he didn’t cooperate in the investigation by providing the form to Congress. Republicans dropped that idea after the FBI let the entire House Oversight Committee privately see the form and other documents.Despite having spent a year investigating the Bidens, Republicans have come up with no evidence of a pay-to-play scheme involving the president. The White House points out that Biden released 25 years of tax returns when he was running for president.How Oversight Republicans are keeping their conspiracy alive“President Joe Biden has participated in his family’s global business ventures with America’s adversaries,” House Republicans wrote in a November report. “He has misused his public positions to further his family’s financial interests.”The evidence: So far, House Republicans have provided no evidence to back that up. Despite reviewing thousands of bank records, they haven’t shown a link between Biden and his family’s business deals. And there is no evidence he personally benefited financially.Also, there is no evidence that Hunter Biden’s business deals with foreign companies were illegal — although what is publicly known about Hunter Biden suggests he was willingly using his famous name to earn money. That raises the question of whether he was willingly being used by foreigners to try to curry favor with his father. After a years-long federal investigation, Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges for failing to pay taxes in 2017 and 2018 totaling $1 million. He will dodge prosecution for buying a gun while he was using crack cocaine, and likely face probation.Hunter Biden has talked openly about his business deals abroad. In a 2019 New Yorker interview, he made clear his father was aware he had taken a job with a Ukrainian gas company. “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’” he recalled.That brings us to the GOP’s third allegation.When Joe Biden was vice president, he did a lot of overseas diplomacy — pushing anti-corruption messages in Romania and Ukraine, for example. Hunter Biden was also doing business in these countries, sometimes at the same time his father was working in them.Republicans subpoenaed bank records from Biden associates to demonstrate that members of the Biden family — but not Joe Biden himself — received $10 million from foreign companies over a period of a few years starting in 2015.They alleged that Hunter Biden was getting money from Romania, funneled to him by an associate. Republicans allege a similar situation in China, months after Joe Biden left the vice presidency. (They say they haven’t started investigating the existence of a money trail in Ukraine. Donald Trump, while president, was impeached by House Democrats in 2019 for pushing Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on the Bidens.)The evidence: So far, Republicans have failed to connect Hunter Biden’s business deals to his father’s work while vice president.Hunter Biden seems to have shadowed his father by chasing business deals abroad. But if there were something nefarious going on, it wasn’t uncovered by the four-year criminal investigation led by a Trump-appointed prosecutor.This GOP allegation of influence-peddling also raises the question of why Republicans don’t investigate Trump’s family. Unlike Hunter Biden, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump held official positions in the White House. Kushner oversaw U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East while running a company that received billions of dollars from Arab nations after he left office.Hunter Biden apparently left a laptop in a Delaware shop before the 2020 election that made its way into Trump allies’ hands.President Biden’s critics have latched onto every ugly detail about the his son’s life — he has struggled with addiction and debt — and combined that with snippets of texts and emails and even nude photos from the laptop to suggest it may be hiding illegal activity.The evidence: These allegations often lack context; for example, sometimes Republicans have made allegations based on just one email plucked from the laptop.And it’s not clear that everything on the laptop is Hunter Biden’s. It’s been passed around in conservative circles for years. The contents that The Washington Post could authenticate suggest that Hunter Biden profited from business deals in China and Ukraine because of his name and connections, but, again, that his father did not.Democrats counter that this entire GOP investigation is a fishing expedition to help Trump win back the White House.The top House Republican investigating the Bidens did recently tie his work to Trump’s poll numbers: “You look at the polling, and right now Donald Trump is seven points ahead of Joe Biden and trending upward, Joe Biden’s trending downward,” said Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.). “And I believe that the media is looking around, scratching their head, and they’re realizing that the American people are keeping up with our investigation.”This article has been updated with the latest news.";Hunter Biden will plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges after a years-long federal investigation into his business deals.After a years-long federal investigation, Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges for failing to pay taxes in 2017 and 2018 totaling $1 million.Unlike Hunter Biden, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump held official positions in the White House.;2023-06-20T16:40:38+00:00;2023-06-21T10:49:53.278978+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60603;Who are the House GOP’s ‘whistleblowers’ about Biden and the FBI?;Republicans have pinned their investigations into Hunter Biden and the FBI on people they say are blowing the whistle to wrongdoing — but many of the allegations are unsubstantiated, vague and come from employees facing disciplinary issues.;"Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, claims a whistleblower has alleged that the FBI has information from a confidential informant — so far unsubstantiated — that President Biden received a bribe from a foreign national before taking office.House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) has touted what he calls whistleblowers, too — people who have alleged wrongdoing and politicization within the ranks of the FBI.Lawmakers have also interviewed a veteran IRS agent who sent a letter to Congress in April seeking whistleblower protection to testify about what he asserts is political interference in the Justice Department investigation into Hunter Biden’s tax returns.Republicans have pinned the success of congressional investigations — which they hope will paint President Biden and his family as corrupt and the federal government as a political tool of the administration — on the allegations of these “whistleblowers.”But Democrats, and some lawyers, argue that some of these people appear simply to be disgruntled employees with unsubstantiated claims, and have questioned whether they should be protected by whistleblower status under the law. Calling them “whistleblowers” has allowed Republicans to share only sparse details about their information, on grounds that the individuals need protection, and that has made their claims hard to vet, said committee staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Here’s what you need to know about the people the GOP is presenting as whistleblowers about alleged wrongdoing by Biden and the FBI.Most federal employees are covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act, which shields them from professional retaliation if they report wrongdoing or abuse, provided they report their information through proper channels, including by speaking with Congress.Employees in the intelligence community and the FBI, however, are covered by different laws, which extend protections if they report wrongdoing to specified managers and offices.The protections offered under the statutes are designed to deter complainants from airing disclosures in the media. But if a complainant makes a disclosure to an official or entity designated under the law and can show that there are grounds to believe there was a violation of laws, rules or regulations, that person is entitled to whistleblower protections.Even if a whistleblower’s complaint is ultimately dismissed as invalid by the agency, the whistleblower is allowed to follow up with a congressional oversight committee, provided that the person follows rules that govern release of classified information.Essentially, if a whistleblower follows the rules, that person is protected by law from professional retaliation — regardless of the merits of the case.“The test is how they made the disclosure in what affords them whistleblower status,” said Mark Zaid, a prominent lawyer who represents whistleblowers and intelligence and military officers. At the same time, a whistleblower does not “get an invulnerability shield to protect you from every action — particularly if the action is independent from the protected disclosures,” Zaid added.Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the IRS, sent Congress a letter in April seeking whistleblower protection to testify about what he asserts is political interference and improper handling of the ongoing Justice Department investigation involving Hunter Biden’s tax returns.The letter also stated that Shapley, who oversees a team of a dozen agents investigating international tax and financial crime, had already reported to the IRS his concerns, including a “failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition of the case.”He has not publicly provided details of his claim.The Washington Post reported last year that federal agents had gathered what they believe was sufficient evidence to charge the president’s son Hunter with tax offenses and a false statement related to a gun purchase. According to court papers filed June 20, Hunter Biden has reached a tentative agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to two minor tax crimes and admit to the facts of a gun charge under terms that would likely keep him out of jail.Shapley told CBS News on May 24 that although he is a registered Republican, he is not politically active, nor has he made any political donations. He also said he has not accepted any financial support to come forward.The attorneys representing Shapley — Tristan Leavitt and Mark Lytle — notified Congress by letter that Shapley and “his entire investigative team are being removed” from the matter “at the request of the Department of Justice.” Shapley was initially represented by Zaid.Shapley appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee on May 26 for a closed-door interview. Committee lawmakers can vote to make the information public and release a transcript of Shapley’s interview.A letter sent by Shapley’s lawyers to IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel revealed that an agent who works for Shapley has also complained about the handling of the case. The letter included an excerpt of an email sent by the unnamed agent complaining that the Justice Department has acted ""inappropriately... for some time” with regard to the matter.An IRS spokesperson said in a statement that while under federal law, the agency can’t comment on specific taxpayer matters, the IRS is “deeply committed to protecting the rights of whistleblowers.”The spokesperson added that Werfel referred the matter to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. “Upon review of the findings and recommendations of any independent authority that completes an investigation of a whistleblower claim, we will take all necessary measures to ensure that whistleblower rights are fully protected,” the spokesperson said.Comer and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) have said an unnamed individual has alleged that the FBI has possession of an unclassified internal document submitted by a confidential informant containing unsubstantiated allegations about President Biden and his family.After Comer threatened to ask Congress to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in contempt, the FBI allowed Comer and Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (Md.), the Oversight Committee’s top Democrat, to review the document in a secure location in the Capitol. It was later shared more widely with committee lawmakers.The FBI previously told Comer that long-standing Justice Department policy limits how confidential human source information can be provided outside the FBI, because it could compromise the source or dissuade others from bringing sensitive information to law enforcement agencies. In a statement, the bureau cautioned: “Documenting the information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information verified by the FBI.”The Post has reported that the FBI and Justice Department under Trump Attorney General William P. Barr reviewed the allegations and determined there were no grounds for further investigative steps.Comer has said that the unverified tip is dated June 30, 2020, and that it alleges a foreign national paid Joe Biden a bribe in exchange for a desired policy outcome.The allegation in the document came to the FBI through the Pittsburgh field office, where Barr had created a channel for allegations involving Ukraine, according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail sensitive information. Such Ukraine allegations included materials Rudy Giuliani — then-President Donald Trump’s personal attorney — had gathered from Ukrainian sources claiming to have damaging information about Biden and his family.Grassley himself has said on Fox News that he has read the document and acknowledged that he is not certain if its allegations are accurate.“We aren’t interested in whether or not the accusations of Biden are accurate or not — we are responsible for making sure the FBI does its job and that’s what we want to know,” Grassley said in a Fox News interview.In a May 14 interview with the Fox Business Network, Comer claimed that the informant who provided the information recorded in the document is now missing.“Unfortunately, we can’t track down the informant,” Comer told host Maria Bartiromo. “We’re hopeful that the informant is still there.”Asked to provide additional details about the informant, he declined to comment.In his role as the chairman of the House select subcommittee on the “weaponization” of the federal government, Jordan has showcased testimony from a number of FBI agents who have aired complaints against the bureau.The FBI has said some of the agents have been disciplined for misconduct, which experts said could undercut their ability to be considered whistleblowers under the law.“These are people who engaged in serious misconduct — they were not just disciplined because they disagreed with the worldview of the FBI,” said Avi Kumin, a lawyer who specializes in assisting government whistleblowers. “So there are a few problems with that in terms of labeling these people as whistleblowers; just saying that you had a difference of opinion is not the same as alleging a violation of the various disclosures that the law for FBI whistleblowers protect.”Stephen Friend resigned as an FBI special agent after being placed on leave. During testimony to the committee on May 18, he claimed that the FBI deviated from standard practices while investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in order to promote a narrative that violent extremism is on the rise. He also said that after raising these concerns with the appropriate personnel, he was retaliated against by having his security clearance suspended. In a statement, Friend said his clearance was revoked the day before he was scheduled to testify, which he termed “highly suspicious.”In a letter sent to Jordan, the FBI said Friend’s security clearance was revoked because of allegations of multiple violations of FBI rules and guidelines.Friend met with the Justice Department’s inspector general to provide more information on May 19.Friend has received financial support from allies of Trump. He told lawmakers that in December, while on unpaid leave from the FBI, he accepted $5,000 from a nonprofit run by Trump ally and former Defense Department official Kash Patel. Friend, now a senior fellow at the Center for Renewing America, also testified that Jordan’s office suggested he reach out to Jason Foster, founder of Empower Oversight and former chief investigative counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee under Grassley, and that his legal fees are now being partly covered by Foster’s group.Marcus Allen, a staff operations specialist at the FBI who was suspended without pay, is also being represented by Leavitt. During a congressional hearing this month, Allen claimed that the bureau retaliated against him by suspending his security clearance because he complained about “the official narrative of the events of Jan. 6.”In a written complaint to the Justice Department inspector general, he questioned the veracity of congressional testimony last year from Director Wray, who had declined at the time to acknowledge whether the government had assets who had infiltrated extremist groups. Some Trump allies have claimed that the Jan. 6 attack was set up by government agents, a baseless allegation refuted by evidence in dozens of criminal cases connected to the assault.“There is a significant counter-story to the events of 6 January 2021 at the US Capitol,” Allen wrote in an email to his superiors after Wray’s testimony. “There is a good possibility the DC elements of our organization are not being forthright about the events of the day or the influence of government assets.”The FBI wrote that Allen “espoused alternative theories” about the Jan. 6 attack “in apparent attempts to hinder investigative activity.” The letter cited an FBI guideline that says agents can be suspended if “there is any reason to suspect an individual’s allegiance to the United States.”Allen is seeking to reverse his suspension, and Leavitt told The Post he believes the inspector general is likely to side with him.Garret O’Boyle, another suspended special agent, was the final FBI witness to testify before Congress in this month’s hearing. He alleged that the FBI tried to force him to perform duties outside normal law enforcement activity and that he was retaliated against when he made disclosures to his chain of command and then to Congress.The details of O’Boyle’s claims are unclear, as he has declined to share the information widely. Democrats, in an extensive report issued in March that challenged the credibility of the FBI agents, said it appeared that O’Boyle was “asked to consider taking a particular investigative step with respect to a January 6 matter; that he declined to do so; and that he suffered no professional repercussions for exercising his judgment.”In a June 8 letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands), members of the House Judiciary Committee, referred O’Boyle to the Justice Department over allegations that he lied to the committee about why his security clearance was suspended by the FBI.During a closed-door interview with lawmakers, Jennifer Moore, the FBI’s executive assistant director for human resources, said the FBI had found O’Boyle responsible for removing sensitive information from an FBI computer and subsequently leaking it to Project Veritas, the right-wing nonprofit known for conducting undercover sting operations. During his committee interview, however, O’Boyle denied leaking information to the media before his suspension, potentially committing perjury, according to Nadler and Plaskett.An FBI investigation into O’Boyle’s security clearance is still active, O’Boyle testified at the hearing. Erica Knight, a spokesperson for O’Boyle, said in a statement that the FBI had failed to demonstrate “any meaningful transparency or accountability” toward O’Boyle.“There are no signs that the bureau will be taking the needed steps to restore trust in the American people, which is what prompted Garret to exercise his whistleblower rights in the first place,” Knight added.";), the Oversight Committee’s top Democrat, to review the document in a secure location in the Capitol.He also said that after raising these concerns with the appropriate personnel, he was retaliated against by having his security clearance suspended.;2023-06-20T16:00:02+00:00;2023-06-21T10:50:02.919956+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60604;The other revelation from Hunter Biden’s plea deal;It seems increasingly unlikely that the Justice Department considered the “$5 million bribe” claim credible.;This article has been updated.Those tuning in to Maria Bartiromo’s Fox News program Sunday would have heard about a crisis of presidential malfeasance that, in Bartiromo’s words, constituted “the biggest political scandal any of us have ever seen.”Not Donald Trump’s retention of classified material or efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. No, she was referring to the allegation that President Biden had taken a $5 million bribe while serving as vice president to aid the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.Most of Bartiromo’s viewers were probably familiar with the story since the conspiratorial Fox host has been hyping it for its month-long existence. If you are not, though, it can be summarized succinctly: An FBI informant talked to one of the founders of Burisma years ago at which point the executive claimed to have made or wanted to make a bribe to Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. He claimed to have recordings of conversations with both, though it’s not clear that these allegedly document the bribe — or as multiple Republicans have admitted‚ whether they exist. The FBI informant conveyed this to the bureau in mid-2020.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThat is the extent of the evidence: a secondhand claim that was vetted by William P. Barr’s Justice Department in 2020 without an investigation being launched. Barr, speaking to Fox News earlier this month, claimed that the document had nonetheless made its way into other open investigations, including one in Delaware — which he confirmed to mean the one targeting Hunter Biden.Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have contested Barr’s version of events, but Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) — a central engine for the “$5 million bribe” narrative — similarly linked the allegations to a Delaware probe after reviewing a summary of the FBI’s interview with its informant.On Tuesday, a plea agreement between Hunter Biden and the federal government became public. He admitted to failing to pay income taxes in two years and, after paying back what was owed, will probably receive probation. A charge related to his purchase of a firearm will probably result in his participation in a diversion program.“With the announcement of two agreements between my client, Hunter Biden, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware,” Biden’s attorney said in a statement, “it is my understanding that the five-year investigation into Hunter is resolved.”Soon after, CNN’s Marchall Cohen reported that the U.S. attorney who led the investigation into Hunter Biden, David Weiss, described the probe as “ongoing” — though it’s not clear what that means. Perhaps there is a different investigation underway in which this alleged $5 million bribe is being considered. Or perhaps the Justice Department didn’t think that those claims from the Burisma executive were credible in the first place.The reaction from Trump’s allies was both immediate and predictable. That Hunter Biden would probably get probation on the tax charges was a sign that the “system is BROKEN!” in Trump’s phrasing on Truth Social. From the moment Trump’s federal indictment was announced last week, it was compared to the treatment of Hunter Biden, first to suggest that the president’s son was escaping punishment (as on the front page of the New York Post) and now to insist that the punishment was too light. (Had Trump turned over the documents he retained in the first place, of course, he probably wouldn’t face any punishment at all.)Again, this was inevitable. But that the Hunter Biden probe reached its conclusion without sweeping charges related to a $5 million payment from a foreign actor is noteworthy in its own right. The Justice Department had the allegation about a “bribe” in 2020 and, three years later, reached a deal on criminal charges that had no obvious relationship to the allegation. Barr’s and Comer’s suggestion that it might still come into play in regards to a case in Delaware has, by outside appearances, come up dry.In a statement, Comer seemed to suggest that he believed that the Justice Department’s role had ended. The “sweetheart deal,” as he described it, would “have no impact on the Oversight Committee’s investigation.”It is not as though Comer and his colleague Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) have uncovered other evidence to bolster the idea. Since declaring publicly in early May that Biden had been accused of bribery, they spent weeks trying to get the FBI to make the documentation of the interview public. Only recently did they subpoena bank records aimed at seeing whether Biden received any such payment — despite having already received and made public other payments to Hunter Biden and his uncle.The bribery allegation has always survived on a diet of nebulousness, with every new detail learned about it only serving to reduce its credibility. Perhaps that will change at some point. But on Tuesday, another ding: That Delaware probe into Hunter Biden didn’t obviously include anything about it.Still “the biggest political scandal any of us have ever seen,” I guess, assuming that you’ve never before seen any other political scandals.;That Hunter Biden would probably get probation on the tax charges was a sign that the “system is BROKEN!” in Trump’s phrasing on Truth Social.But that the Hunter Biden probe reached its conclusion without sweeping charges related to a $5 million payment from a foreign actor is noteworthy in its own right.Since declaring publicly in early May that Biden had been accused of bribery, they spent weeks trying to get the FBI to make the documentation of the interview public.;2023-06-20T15:57:37+00:00;2023-06-21T10:50:11.543988+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
60605;Trump is offering talking points, not defenses;Donald Trump is making it hard to win a legal victory in the classified documents case — but, he no doubt hopes, easier to win the presidency.;"The most famous photo from the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago last year shows an array of documents spread on the floral carpet of a room at the facility. Some of what’s shown includes cover sheets for classified material, indicating that the attached documents have been determined to be “secret” or “top secret.” Other documents, some obscured with white boxes by the Justice Department, have visible classification identifiers at the top of standard sheets of paper.This is the photo that former president Donald Trump would subsequently suggest had been staged by the FBI to make it look like it had stumbled onto an orgy of classified material lazily thrown on the floor. The context of the photo makes obvious that’s not the case, though, with the inclusion of a photo scale and a small folded card labeled “2A.” The photo was meant not to impugn Trump directly but only indirectly, as evidence.What’s important in the wake of a revealing interview of Trump on Monday by Fox News’s Bret Baier, though, is that folded card.Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpThe “2A” identifier corresponds to the government’s documentation of the evidence it collected at Mar-a-Lago during the search. In the manifest of what was seized, Item 2A is listed as “[v]arious classified/TS/SCI documents.” It is apparently a subset of Item 2, identified as a “[l]eather-bound box of documents.” That box and its contents were removed not from the storage room near the Mar-a-Lago pool but from Trump’s office, where he was in the habit of entertaining visitors.So now we jump to what Trump told Baier.The Fox News host walked through the indictment made public this month. He asked Trump directly: Why, given that the Justice Department had eventually obtained a subpoena for any material marked as classified, hadn’t Trump simply handed that material over?“Because I had boxes,” Trump replied. “I want to go through the boxes and get all my personal things out. I don’t want to hand that over to [the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)] yet. And I was very busy, as you’ve sort of seen.”“But according to the indictment,” Baier pressed, “you then tell this aide to move [material] to other locations after telling your lawyers to say you’ve fully complied with the subpoena when you hadn’t.”“But before I send boxes over, I have to take all of my things out,” Trump said. “These boxes were interspersed with all sorts of things, golf shirts, clothing, pants, shoes. There were many things.”This, too, is indexed in the list of material provided by the government: boxes that included both classified material and news articles, or items of clothing, or gifts. What the FBI removed from the storage room was a mix of all sorts of stuff — itself potentially damning when considering how material identified as classified was handled.But none of this applies to Item 2, that box. It isn’t identified as “a box with some shirts and a few documents.” It’s just a box — a leather-bound one — sitting in Trump’s office, with documents. In that, it seems, were the documents that appear in that famous photo. Of the 15 documents originally identified by the FBI as bearing “top secret” classification, six were found in the Item 2A batch. Four were “TS/SCI,” which means they were classified as “top secret” and included “sensitive compartmented information,” a more restricted level of control.They were in that box, in Trump’s office.So how does this comport with Trump’s claim that he didn’t have time to rifle through those boxes and pick out his personal material? His criminal defense team will have to figure out a way to explain the gap, but the simple answer is that it doesn’t.The defense is ludicrous, in general, of course. Trump had already worked his way through some of what he removed from the White House after he left, giving more than a dozen boxes to NARA in January 2022. The idea that over the next seven months he’d made no more progress defies credulity, particularly given numerous occasions during which he was engaged in any of his various leisure activities.But Item 2A torpedoes the argument completely. He had these documents in that box in his office and unquestionably knew they were there. When the government subpoena arrived, that collection would have been trivial to flag for his lawyers to hand over (as they did some documents in June 2022). He chose not to.So the question is why Trump made this claim to Baier. Here, again, the answer seems simple: He’s fighting a political fight, not a legal one.As I wrote last week, assuming that Trump doesn’t agree to a plea deal, his best bet for escaping punishment for his retention of classified material is to win the presidency. This isn’t a sure thing, certainly, but it seems likely that he can win the Republican nomination and possible that he could defeat Joe Biden in November 2024. If that happens, Justice Department prohibitions on trying a sitting president kick in — and Trump gets to test the ability of a president to pardon himself.It’s easy to overthink what Trump is up to, of course, because he is not known for his multidimensional strategies. Trump’s instinct here is the one that’s guided him in politics since he announced his candidacy eight years ago and in business well before that: Say what you need to say to close the deal with the audience.He’s also learned that his core base of support, and those eager to leverage that base, don’t need a lot of explanation to side with him in his various fights against his perceived oppressors. So while his “I had to get my golf shirts out of those boxes” excuse is particularly weak as a criminal defense and completely useless when considering Item 2A, it may prove to be more than enough for any supporters who, like Baier, didn’t get why he didn’t simply respond to the subpoena. Oh, he was busy! Makes sense. This must just be the “Deep State” doing another hoax.Trump did something similar when Baier asked about the recording, cited in the indictment, in which Trump told authors interviewing him in 2021 about a classified document he appeared to be brandishing.Not so, Trump insisted.“There was no document. That was a massive amount of papers and everything else talking about Iran and other things,” Trump said on Fox News. “And it may have been held up or may not, but that was not a document. I didn’t have a document per se. There was nothing to declassify. These were newspaper stories, magazine stories and articles.”If this case goes to trial (which we have to assume that some on his legal team have been energetically recommending against that), there will at some point be a witness who attests to making that recording. One or more of the authors with whom Trump was speaking or staffers who were nearby will be asked, under oath, what Trump had at hand and what he appeared to be referring to. It’s a very, very safe bet that special counsel Jack Smith’s team already knows exactly what those witnesses might have to say and presumably have affidavits to that effect. In other words, the odds are very good that Trump’s “I was referring to news articles” line will hold up poorly when the government makes its case.Trump undoubtedly knows what happened and certainly knows if he had a classified document in his possession at that time. It is very possible that he’s simply lying to Baier, trying to excuse away one of the most evocative, potentially incriminating aspects of the case.If so, it’s a short-term win aimed at giving his allies something to say beyond, “Yeah, it looks bad.” Now the line goes forth: Trump was just talking about newspaper articles and Trump didn’t have time to go through all those boxes. It doesn’t even really matter if those excuses don’t hold up; the central viewpoint is that Trump is right and his oppressors are wrong and the facts are massaged or swapped out as needed to make that argument most effectively in the moment.Again, this is a political-slash-rhetorical approach, not a particularly robust legal one. Trump’s freedom, though, may depend on his political strength and not his lawyers’ ability to introduce reasonable doubt in a courtroom.In other words, all of the completely justified astonishment at Trump’s eternal willingness to implicate himself may be missing the point. He doesn’t need to win in front of a jury if he can win on Election Day. And voters don’t care about rules of evidence. Voters don’t make you swear under oath to the claims you’re making.The election is the ideal venue for Trump to make his case.";It isn’t identified as “a box with some shirts and a few documents.” It’s just a box — a leather-bound one — sitting in Trump’s office, with documents.That was a massive amount of papers and everything else talking about Iran and other things,” Trump said on Fox News.Voters don’t make you swear under oath to the claims you’re making.The election is the ideal venue for Trump to make his case.;2023-06-20T14:22:31+00:00;2023-06-21T10:50:21.076802+00:00;827;Politics;3549;The Reading Must
